## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors (Similar Positioning)

| Competitor | Target Persona | Positioning | Weaknesses | ScaleUp Advantage |
|------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Focused Labs** | Startups | Product development partner | Higher price point ($50K+) | More accessible for smaller projects |
| **CIENCE** | B2B Services | Lead gen + tech | Heavy sales pressure; mixed reviews | Relationship-based, consultative |
| **Directive** | SaaS/Tech | Performance marketing | $10K/month minimums | Full-service including dev |
| **SmartSites** | SMB broadly | Volume digital agency | Less strategic; execution focus | ROI-focused with accountability |

### Indirect Competitors (Alternative Solutions)

| Alternative | When Chosen | Weakness vs. ScaleUp |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Upwork/Fiverr** | Budget constrained | No strategic thinking; quality inconsistent |
| **Internal Hire** | Need full-time capacity | $150K+ annual cost; management burden |

3. **Cross-Service Capability:** Dev + Growth + AI/Automation under one roof is uncommon at ScaleUp's price point
4. **Founder Accessibility:** Small team = direct access to decision-makers, unlike agencies where clients talk to account managers
