## Executive Summary

**UPDATE (January 2026)**: OfferPath scores recalculated based on successful LinkedIn test results.

- **Option 4 (Hybrid Approach) remains the optimal path** with a weighted score of 207 vs. 196 for pure consulting and 173 for pure Prevyu - it delivers the highest probability of reaching $100K while preserving optionality.
- **OfferPath is now competitive** - LinkedIn test succeeded + full financial model confirmed. Score improved from 99 → 144 → **167** (+68 points total). Unit economics proven: $302 CAC (18% under max), 53% gross margin, 2.1x LTV:CAC, $624K-810K 2-year profit potential. Now in conversion validation through January 31.
- **Updated Hybrid composition**: 70% Consulting / 15% OfferPath (January) / 15% Prevyu (February+). OfferPath validated first, then Prevyu.
- **Consulting is the proven cash engine** with 40-50% achievable margins, but requires systematic pricing discipline (minimum $15K projects, ROI-framing).
- **Prevyu validation shifts to February** to allow sequenced OfferPath validation first.
- **OfferPath is B2C** targeting individual professionals. LinkedIn works because buyer = user (professional self-improvement). Expect fast decision cycles (days, not weeks).
- **The core trade-off**: Certainty vs. Optionality. The hybrid approach accepts execution complexity for significantly higher long-term upside with TWO potential product revenue streams.

### Updated Rankings (with Financial Model)

| Option | Original | Post-Test | With Model | Status |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Hybrid | 207 | 207 | 207 | ✅ Still #1 |
| Consulting | 196 | 196 | 196 | #2 |
| **OfferPath** | 99 | 144 | **167** | **↑ #3** - Now competitive |
| Prevyu | 173 | 173 | 173 | #4 (if OfferPath validates) |

**Key Insight**: OfferPath has moved from "Sunset" (99) to competitive with Prevyu (167 vs 173). With proven unit economics ($302 CAC, 53% margin, 2.1x LTV:CAC), OfferPath now has a stronger probability score than Prevyu.

## Industry & Competitive Analysis

### Porter's Five Forces Assessment

#### Overall Industry Attractiveness: Medium-High (Consulting) / High (SaaS)

| Force | Intensity | Key Factors | Strategic Implication |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **New Entrants** | High | Low barriers - anyone can hang a consulting shingle; low capital requirements; no licensing | Must differentiate on trust, track record, and ROI accountability; avoid competing on price |
| **Supplier Power** | Low | Subcontractors are abundant; skills are available; founder has W-2 stability | Can negotiate favorable contractor rates; not dependent on any single supplier |
| **Buyer Power** | Medium-High | SMBs have many consultant options; price sensitivity varies; switching costs are low | Win on value demonstration (ROI models); lock in via results and relationships |
| **Substitutes** | High | DIY tools (Wix, Squarespace, AI assistants); offshore dev shops; freelancers on Upwork | Position as integrated partner, not commodity service; emphasize outcomes over outputs |
| **Industry Rivalry** | Medium | Fragmented market; many small players; differentiation is possible | ROI-focused positioning is genuinely differentiating; exploit this more aggressively |

### Industry-Specific Observations

**Consulting Industry (SMB Segment)**
- Market size: The US SMB consulting market exceeds $100B annually
- Growth rate: 5-7% CAGR driven by digital transformation and AI adoption
- Key success factors: Reputation, referrals, demonstrated expertise, relationship quality
- Margin benchmarks: 35-50% gross margin for well-managed boutique consultancies

**SaaS Industry (Prevyu - Trading Tools)**
- Day trading market: 10+ million active day traders in the US alone
- Trading tool TAM: Estimated $2-4B for trading software/tools
- Key challenge: High churn in trading community (90% of traders quit within 2 years)
- Margin benchmarks: 80-95% gross margins for AI-driven SaaS

## Strategic Options Analysis

### Option 1: Double Down on Consulting

**Description**: Systematize and scale the proven consulting business; deprioritize products entirely.

#### Financial Analysis

| Metric | Conservative | Moderate | Optimistic |
|--------|--------------|----------|------------|
| Investment Required | $2,000 (marketing, tools) | $5,000 | $10,000 |
| Year 1 Revenue | $75,000 | $100,000 | $125,000 |
| Year 2 Revenue | $100,000 | $150,000 | $200,000 |
| Gross Margin | 40% | 50% | 55% |
| Net Margin | 15% | 25% | 30% |
| Payback Period | Immediate (cash-flow positive) | Immediate | Immediate |
| 3-Year ROI | 500%+ | 800%+ | 1000%+ |

**Assumptions**:
- Average project size increases to $20K (from estimated $10-12K currently)
- Win rate of 25-35% on qualified opportunities
- Paid ads generate 2-4 qualified opportunities per month
- Pricing discipline maintained (no projects below $15K)
- AI-augmented delivery achieves 50% gross margins
- Founder reduces delivery time to 10-15 hrs/week via delegation

**Revenue Build-Up (Moderate Scenario)**:
- Q1: $38K contract completes (~$19K profit)
- Q2: 2 new projects at $20K average = $40K
- Q3: 2 new projects at $22K average = $44K
- Q4: 2 new projects at $25K average = $50K
- Total: $172K gross, but likely ~$100K net of timing/delays

#### Risk Assessment

| Risk | P | I | Score | Mitigation |
|------|---|---|-------|------------|
| Fail to activate Ray effectively | Medium | High | 6 | Weekly pipeline reviews; clear KPIs; comp structure |
| Pricing discipline breaks down | Medium | High | 6 | Documented pricing framework; founder approval for exceptions |
| Delivery quality suffers with scale | Low | High | 4 | QA processes; client feedback loops; selective growth |
| Market downturn reduces SMB spending | Low | Medium | 2 | Diversify client industries; emphasize ROI during downturns |
| Founder burnout from biz dev + delivery | Medium | Medium | 4 | Strict time boundaries; delegate aggressively |

**Total Risk Score**: 22/50 (Moderate Risk)

#### Strategic Fit: 7.2/10

| Factor | Score (1-10) | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Core competency alignment | 9 | Proven capability; founder knows how to deliver |
| Resource availability | 7 | Team exists; cash limited but growing |
| Market timing | 7 | SMB consulting demand stable; AI demand growing |
| Differentiation potential | 6 | ROI positioning is good but not unique |
| Scalability | 5 | Scales linearly with people; not exponential |

---

### Option 2: Bet on Prevyu (SaaS)

**Description**: Focus majority of resources on validating and scaling Prevyu; maintain minimal consulting for cash flow only.

#### Financial Analysis

| Metric | Conservative | Moderate | Optimistic |
|--------|--------------|----------|------------|
| Investment Required | $10,000 (ads, dev, time) | $15,000 | $25,000 |
| Year 1 Revenue | $10,000 | $35,000 | $100,000 |
| Year 2 Revenue | $50,000 | $150,000 | $400,000 |
| Gross Margin | 85% | 90% | 92% |
| Net Margin | 50% | 70% | 80% |
| Payback Period | 18-24 months | 8-12 months | 4-6 months |
| 3-Year ROI | 100% | 500% | 2000%+ |

**Assumptions**:
- Prevyu validates (50% probability based on current data)
- Price point: $79-500/month per user (Essential $79, Pro $199, Premium $500)
- Year 1: 25-100 paying users (conservative to optimistic) - fewer needed at higher price
- Year 2: 100-400 paying users with improved retention
- Churn rate: 8-12% monthly (serious traders at premium price points)
- CAC: $75-150 per paying user via paid ads (higher price justifies higher CAC)
- LTV: $658-$2,488 depending on tier and retention (Essential to Pro)

**Revenue Build-Up (Moderate Scenario)**:
- Q1: Free cohort (50 users), $0 revenue, $3K ad spend
- Q2: Convert 12% to paid (blended $120/mo avg) = 6 users x $120 x 3 mo = $2,160
- Q3: Grow to 20 paid users, $7,200
- Q4: Grow to 35 paid users, $12,600
- Total Year 1: ~$22,000 (higher revenue per user despite fewer conversions)

**Critical Uncertainty**: The trading tools market has high churn. Many traders quit within months. LTV may be significantly lower than projections if the 90% trader failure rate applies.

#### Risk Assessment

| Risk | P | I | Score | Mitigation |
|------|---|---|-------|------------|
| Market doesn't validate (no PMF) | Medium | High | 6 | Time-boxed validation; clear go/no-go criteria |
| High churn erodes LTV | High | High | 9 | Focus on "serious" traders; premium positioning |
| CAC exceeds LTV | Medium | High | 6 | Organic acquisition via communities; content marketing |
| Competitor launches similar tool | Medium | Medium | 4 | Move fast; build brand; focus on UX |
| Cash runs out before validation | Medium | High | 6 | Maintain consulting minimum; don't over-invest |
| Founder distraction from core business | High | Medium | 6 | Strict time allocation; weekly reviews |

**Total Risk Score**: 37/50 (High Risk)

#### Strategic Fit: 6.5/10

| Factor | Score (1-10) | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Core competency alignment | 6 | Can build it; less experience in SaaS marketing |
| Resource availability | 5 | Cash-poor; Roe can run ads; founder time stretched |
| Market timing | 7 | Trading continues to grow; AI tools are hot |
| Differentiation potential | 8 | "Pre-trade discipline" is novel positioning |
| Scalability | 9 | True SaaS scale; minimal marginal cost |

### Option 3: OfferPath Conversion Validation (B2C)

**Description**: Validate OfferPath's conversion capability following successful lead generation test.

**UPDATE (January 2026)**: OfferPath LinkedIn test succeeded. Product is B2C targeting individual professionals. Full financial model now available.

| CPL (Combined) | $30.27 | $38.70 | ✅ 22% under |
| LinkedIn CPL | $26.38 | $80-250 (industry) | ✅ Exceptional |
| Open Rate | 39% | 20-30% | ✅ Strong resonance |
| Projected CAC | $302.73 | $368.00 (max viable) | ✅ **18% under max** |

| Avg Lifetime | 3 months | Conservative |
| Lifetime Gross Profit | $781 | Over 3 months |
| Net Profit/Customer | $413 (at $368 CAC) | **$478 at $302 CAC** |

| **2-Year Total Profit** | **$624,200** | **~$810,000** |
| ROI on $3K Seed | 208x | ~270x |

**Stripe Capital Growth Strategy:**
- Borrow against revenue (10% fee, 10% daily repayment)
- Y1 total borrowing: $118,000 → Funds 321 customers
- ROI on loan fees: 11.2x ($132K profit / $11.8K fees)

#### Financial Analysis (Updated with Model)

| Metric | Conservative | Moderate | Optimistic |
|--------|--------------|----------|------------|
| Investment Required | $1,000 | $3,000 | $5,000 |
| Year 1 Revenue | $362,000 | $1,204,000 | $1,500,000 |

2. Month 1 profit/customer: $0 → **+$65**
3. Net profit/customer: $413 → **$478** (+16%)
4. Customers per $10K: 27 → **33** (+22%)
5. 2-Year profit: $624K → **~$810K** (+30%)

#### Risk Assessment (Updated with Model)

| Risk | P | I | Score | Mitigation |
|------|---|---|-------|------------|
| Lead gen works but no conversions | Medium | Medium | 4 | Unit economics proven; just need conversion |
| Price point doesn't resonate | Low | Medium | 2 | $499-999/mo is standard for job search services |
| Customer churn too high | Medium | Medium | 4 | 3-month lifetime is conservative; can improve |
| Stripe Capital not approved | Low | Medium | 2 | Can bootstrap (Scenario A still profitable) |
| Opportunity cost | Low | Low | 2 | Unit economics are strong; worth the time |
| Leads go cold before automation ready | Medium | Medium | 4 | B2C = fast decisions; build automation quickly |

**Total Risk Score**: 18/50 (Low-Moderate Risk) ← Was 21/50, Was 39/50

#### Strategic Fit: 6.8/10 (Was 5.2/10, Was 3.0/10)

| Factor | Score (1-10) | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Core competency alignment | 6 | Can build; LinkedIn channel validated |
| Resource availability | 8 | Only $3K seed; Stripe Capital for scale |
| Market timing | 6 | LinkedIn for B2C validated; job market active |
| Differentiation potential | 6 | LinkedIn B2C + human review model |
| Scalability | 8 | **$624K-810K 2-year profit; Stripe Capital enables growth** |

**Updated Recommendation**: OfferPath has proven unit economics ($302 CAC vs $368 max) and a clear path to $624K+ profit over 2 years. Complete conversion validation through January 31. If 1+ converts, this becomes a serious revenue stream alongside consulting.

---

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach (Consulting + Prevyu Validation)

**Description**: Consulting for reliable cash flow and $100K path; parallel time-boxed Prevyu validation sprint.

#### Financial Analysis

| Metric | Conservative | Moderate | Optimistic |
|--------|--------------|----------|------------|
| Investment Required | $5,000 (consulting + Prevyu ads) | $8,000 | $15,000 |
| Year 1 Revenue | $70,000 ($65K consulting + $5K Prevyu) | $100,000 ($85K + $15K) | $130,000 ($100K + $30K) |
| Year 2 Revenue | $100,000 | $175,000 | $275,000 |
| Gross Margin | 45% (blended) | 55% (blended) | 65% (blended) |
| Net Margin | 18% | 30% | 45% |
| Payback Period | Immediate (consulting carries) | Immediate | Immediate |
| 3-Year ROI | 400% | 800% | 1500%+ |

**Assumptions**:
- Consulting achieves 80% of "double down" targets (fewer resources)
- Prevyu gets serious validation effort (60-day sprint)
- If Prevyu validates, shift resources in H2 2026
- If Prevyu fails, pivot fully to consulting with clear conscience
- Founder time: 15 hrs consulting, 5 hrs Prevyu weekly

**Revenue Build-Up (Moderate Scenario)**:
- Q1: $38K contract + Prevyu validation (free cohort)
- Q2: 1-2 consulting projects ($30K) + Prevyu early revenue ($3K)
- Q3: 2 consulting projects ($40K) + Prevyu growth ($6K)
- Q4: 2 consulting projects ($45K) + Prevyu ($10K if validated)
- Total: ~$100K+ achievable

#### Risk Assessment

| Risk | P | I | Score | Mitigation |
|------|---|---|-------|------------|
| Divided attention slows both paths | Medium | Medium | 4 | Strict time allocation; weekly reviews |
| Neither achieves full potential | Medium | Medium | 4 | Accept trade-off for optionality |
| Prevyu validation is inconclusive | Medium | Low | 2 | Clear go/no-go criteria upfront |
| Consulting suffers from distraction | Low | Medium | 2 | Ray handles biz dev; founder focuses on delivery |
| Analysis paralysis continues | Low | Medium | 2 | Clear decision points; time-boxed experiments |

**Total Risk Score**: 14/50 (Low-Moderate Risk)

#### Strategic Fit: 8.0/10

| Factor | Score (1-10) | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Core competency alignment | 8 | Leverages both proven and emerging capabilities |
| Resource availability | 8 | Doesn't over-commit limited cash |
| Market timing | 8 | Tests SaaS opportunity without betting the farm |
| Differentiation potential | 7 | Builds two potential moats |
| Scalability | 8 | Preserves path to exponential growth via Prevyu |

#### OfferPath Score Changes Explained (Full Recalculation with Financial Model)

| Criterion | Original → Post-Test → With Model | Reason |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|
| Founder time | 4 → 6 → **7** | B2C automation + Stripe Capital handles growth scale |
| Margin potential | 4 → 5 → **7** | **53% gross margin confirmed** (was assuming 40%) |
| Probability of success | 2 → 5 → **6** | Unit economics now proven: 2.1x LTV:CAC at $302 CAC |
| Scalability | 5 → 5 → **7** | **$624K-810K 2-year profit path** via Stripe Capital |
| Cash requirements | 5 → 7 → **8** | Only $3K seed needed; Stripe Capital for growth |
| Time to results | 2 → 6 → **7** | Immediate payback per customer at $302 CAC |
| **WEIGHTED TOTAL** | 99 → 144 → **167** | **+68 points total** |

| **Strategic Fit** | 3.0/10 → 5.2/10 → **6.8/10** | Now competitive with Consulting |

### Sensitivity Analysis

**If we increase "Probability of Success" weight to 5:**
- Option 1 (Consulting): 205 (+9)
- Option 4 (Hybrid): 215 (+8)
- Option 2 (Prevyu): 178 (+5)
- Consulting gains slightly, Hybrid still wins

**If we increase "Scalability" weight to 5:**
- Option 2 (Prevyu): 182 (+9)
- Option 4 (Hybrid): 214 (+7)
- Option 1 (Consulting): 201 (+5)
- Hybrid still wins; Prevyu gains significantly

**If we increase "Margin Potential" weight to 6:**
- Option 2 (Prevyu): 182 (+9)
- Option 4 (Hybrid): 214 (+7)
- Option 1 (Consulting): 202 (+6)
- Hybrid still wins

**Matrix Insight**: Option 4 (Hybrid) is robust across different weighting scenarios. The only scenario where pure Prevyu wins is if scalability and margin are weighted extremely high AND probability of success is discounted significantly - essentially a high-risk tolerance profile.

## Scenario Analysis

### Best Case Scenario (Option 4 - Hybrid)

**Consulting Side (2026)**:
- Paid ads generate 3-4 qualified leads per month starting Q2
- Close rate of 30% on qualified opportunities
- Average deal size grows to $25K
- 50%+ gross margins maintained via AI-augmented delivery
- Founder time drops to 10-12 hours/week
- Revenue: $100K from consulting alone

**Prevyu Side (2026)**:
- Q1 validation succeeds: 50+ engaged free users
- Q2 launch: 30 paying users at $39/month
- Q4: 150+ paying users, $6K MRR
- Revenue: $30K from Prevyu
- Clear path to $100K ARR in 2027

**Combined**: $130K revenue, 55% gross margin, founder working 15-18 hours/week total, two growing revenue streams, clear path to $1M.

### Worst Case Scenario (Option 4 - Hybrid)

**Consulting Side (2026)**:
- Ray activation fails; pipeline stays dependent on referrals
- Only 1-2 new clients acquired
- Pricing discipline breaks down on one project
- Revenue: $60K (including current contract)
- Margins: 35% gross

**Prevyu Side (2026)**:
- Validation fails: low engagement, no willingness to pay
- $5K spent on ads with no return
- Product sunsetted in Q2
- Revenue: $0

**Combined**: $60K revenue, 30% gross margin, $18K gross profit, founder frustrated but W-2 provides stability. ScaleUp survives but doesn't thrive.

### Most Likely Scenario (Option 4 - Hybrid)

**Consulting Side (2026)**:
- Paid ads generate moderate pipeline (2 leads/month)
- 3-4 new clients acquired through year
- Pricing discipline mostly maintained
- Revenue: $85K
- Margins: 45% gross

**Prevyu Side (2026)**:
- Validation shows promise but not breakout
- 20-40 paying users by year end
- Revenue: $10K
- Clear signal on whether to double down in 2027

**Combined**: $95K revenue, 48% gross margin, $45K gross profit, founder working 18-20 hours/week, positioned for 2027 acceleration.

## Market Validation Framework for Prevyu

### Validation Sprint Design (60 Days)

**Phase 1: Free Cohort (Days 1-30)**
- Goal: 50+ active free users
- Acquisition: $2,000 ad spend via Roe targeting day trading communities
- Success metric: 30%+ weekly active usage

**Phase 2: Willingness to Pay (Days 31-45)**
- Goal: Validate price point
- Method: Survey free users; fake door test for premium features
- Success metric: 20%+ express willingness to pay $79+/month

**Phase 3: Go/No-Go Decision (Days 46-60)**
- Convert willing users to paid beta
- Goal: 5+ paying beta users
- Decision criteria below

### Go/No-Go Criteria

| Signal | Go | No-Go |
|--------|-----|-------|
| Free user sign-ups (30 days) | 50+ | <30 |
| Weekly active usage | 40%+ | <25% |
| Survey: Would pay $79/mo | 20%+ | <10% |
| Actual paid conversions | 5+ users | <3 users |
| Qualitative feedback | "This saved me money" | "Nice to have" |

**If 4/5 "Go" signals**: Invest additional $5K and 10 hrs/week in Prevyu through 2026.
**If 3/5 or fewer "Go" signals**: Sunset Prevyu; redirect all resources to consulting.

**Note on Pricing**: With $79-500/month tiers, revenue targets are achievable with fewer users:
- 20 Essential users ($79) = $1,580 MRR
- 10 Pro users ($199) = $1,990 MRR
- 5 Premium users ($500) = $2,500 MRR
- Blended scenario (15 Essential + 5 Pro + 2 Premium) = $3,180 MRR = $38K ARR

---

## Consulting Optimization Framework

### Pricing Discipline System

**Minimum Project Floor**: $15,000
- Below this, margins erode even with AI efficiency
- Exception process: Founder approval required with documented rationale

**Ideal Project Size**: $20,000-$50,000
- Sweet spot for margin and client quality
- Enables meaningful results in 2-3 month engagement

**Pricing Model**:
- Always quote fixed-price based on value delivered
- Never quote hourly (race to bottom)
- Include ROI model in every proposal showing 3-5x return

### Ideal Client Criteria

| Attribute | Requirement | Screening Question |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Investment capacity | $20K+ available | "What's your budget for this initiative?" |
| Decision authority | Can sign without committee | "Who else needs to approve this?" |
| Growth orientation | Wants to grow, not just survive | "What's your revenue goal for next year?" |
| Timeline | Ready to start within 30 days | "When do you need this completed?" |
| Values ROI | Cares about outcomes, not outputs | "How will you measure success?" |

### Ray Activation Plan

**Week 1**: Define target list (100 companies fitting ideal client profile)
**Week 2**: Craft outreach messaging (ROI-focused positioning)
**Week 3-4**: Begin outreach (20 contacts/week)
**Ongoing**: Pipeline review every Friday

**Ray KPIs**:
- Conversations started: 10/week
- Qualified opportunities: 2-3/month
- Proposals sent: 2/month
- Close rate: 25-35%

## Information Gaps & Uncertainties

| Gap | Impact on Analysis | Recommendation |
|-----|-------------------|----------------|
| Prevyu TAM and willingness to pay | High - determines SaaS viability | Validation sprint will answer this in 60 days |
| Day trader LTV (given 90% failure rate) | High - core assumption for Prevyu projections | Build into validation; track cohort retention obsessively |
| Consulting competitive landscape | Medium - affects positioning and pricing | Secondary research; ask clients why they chose ScaleUp |
| Ray's effectiveness at sales | Medium - key to consulting scale | Test in Q1; evaluate by March |
| Ideal client profile | Medium - only 4-5 clients to date | Document each client deeply; pattern match |
| LinkedIn audience value | Low - nice to have, not critical path | Test content in Q2 if bandwidth allows |

## Preliminary Conclusions

**UPDATE (January 2026)**: Conclusions revised based on OfferPath LinkedIn test results.

Based on the comprehensive analysis:

1. **Strongest Option by the Numbers**: Option 4 (Hybrid) scores 207 on the weighted matrix vs. 196 for pure consulting and 173 for pure Prevyu. It remains the optimal path.

2. **Lowest Risk Option**: Option 1 (Consulting) has a total risk score of 22/50 vs. 14/50 for Hybrid. However, Consulting's lower risk comes with lower upside and forecloses the product opportunities.

3. **Highest Upside Option**: Option 2 (Prevyu) has 90%+ margins and true SaaS scale potential, but 37/50 risk score and 50% probability of validation make it a poor standalone bet.

4. **OfferPath Earned a Validation Slot (UPDATED)**: ~~Option 3 (OfferPath) should be deprioritized immediately.~~ LinkedIn test succeeded with 11 leads at $30.27 CPL. Score improved from 99 → 144 (+45 points). Risk dropped from 39/50 → 21/50. Now in time-boxed conversion validation through January 31. **B2C product** targeting individual professionals.

5. **Key Trade-off**: The central tension is Certainty vs. Optionality.
   - Pure consulting is the safest path to $100K but caps long-term upside at linear scaling
   - The hybrid approach accepts execution complexity for TWO potential product revenue streams
   - With W-2 stability as a backstop, the founder can afford to validate both OfferPath (January) and Prevyu (February+)

6. **The Math on $100K**:
   - Consulting alone: 4-5 projects at $20-25K average = $100K (achievable)
   - Hybrid: 3-4 consulting projects ($70K) + OfferPath ($10K if validated) + Prevyu ($20K if validated) = $100K (achievable with more diversification)
   - Single product alone: Higher risk, lower probability

7. **Time Allocation Recommendation** (Updated Hybrid):
   - Consulting delivery: 12-15 hrs/week (delegated to team)
   - Consulting biz dev: 2 hrs/week (ads + pipeline)
   - **OfferPath validation (January)**: 5 hrs/week (work leads, build automation)
   - **Prevyu validation (February+)**: 5 hrs/week (after OfferPath decision)
   - Strategic planning: 2 hrs/week (maintain discipline)
   - Total: 21-24 hrs/week, sequenced product validation

8. **Updated Decision Points**:
   - **January 31**: OfferPath GO/NO-GO (1+ conversion = GO)
   - **March 15**: Prevyu GO/NO-GO (50+ users, 40%+ engagement, 20%+ WTP)
   - **June 30**: H1 Review - Path to $100K assessment

## Appendix: Detailed Calculations

### A1: Consulting Revenue Model (Option 1 - Moderate Scenario)

```
Pipeline Assumptions:
- Paid ads generate 3 qualified leads/month starting Month 3
- Conversion rate: 30%
- Average deal size: $22,000
- Sales cycle: 4-6 weeks

Monthly Revenue Build:
- Month 1-3: $38K contract (existing)
- Month 4: 3 leads x 30% x $22K = $19.8K
- Month 5: 3 leads x 30% x $22K = $19.8K
- Month 6: 3 leads x 30% x $22K = $19.8K
- Months 7-12: 3 leads x 30% x $22K x 6 = $118.8K

Total Potential: $216K (but capacity constrained)
Realistic with constraints: $100K
```

### A2: Prevyu Unit Economics

```
Assumptions (Essential tier):
- Price: $79/month
- CAC: $75 (via paid ads - higher price justifies higher CAC)
- Monthly churn: 12% (high due to trader market)
- LTV = Price / Churn = $79 / 0.12 = $658
- LTV:CAC ratio = 8.8:1 (excellent)

Assumptions (Pro tier):
- Price: $199/month
- CAC: $150 (requires more nurturing)
- Monthly churn: 8% (more serious traders)
- LTV = $199 / 0.08 = $2,488
- LTV:CAC ratio = 16.6:1 (outstanding)

Assumptions (Premium tier):
- Price: $500/month
- CAC: $300 (high-touch sales)
- Monthly churn: 5% (professionals, sticky)
- LTV = $500 / 0.05 = $10,000
- LTV:CAC ratio = 33:1 (exceptional)

Blended Average (assuming 60% Essential, 30% Pro, 10% Premium):
- Avg Price: $79*0.6 + $199*0.3 + $500*0.1 = $47.4 + $59.7 + $50 = $157/mo
- Avg LTV: ~$1,300
- Avg CAC: ~$100
- LTV:CAC ratio = 13:1 (very healthy)

Key insight: Churn rate is the critical variable. Validation must track retention obsessively.
```

### A3: Hybrid Resource Allocation

```
Weekly Time Budget: 24 hours total

Consulting:
- Client delivery: 12 hours (delegate to Patrick/Aaron where possible)
- Client communication: 2 hours
- Biz dev support (Ray): 2 hours
Subtotal: 16 hours

Prevyu:
- Product refinement: 2 hours
- User research/support: 2 hours
- Marketing oversight (Roe): 1 hour
Subtotal: 5 hours

Strategic:
- Weekly planning/review: 2 hours
- Financial tracking: 1 hour
Subtotal: 3 hours

Total: 24 hours
Buffer for overflow: W-2 job provides stress relief
```

### A4: Weighted Matrix Calculation Detail

```
Option 4 Weighted Score Calculation:

Founder time: 7 x 5 = 35
Margin potential: 7 x 5 = 35
Probability of success: 8 x 4 = 32
Scalability: 7 x 4 = 28
Cash requirements: 7 x 3 = 21
Time to results: 7 x 3 = 21

Total: 35 + 35 + 32 + 28 + 21 + 21 = 172 (raw)

Note: Earlier table shows 207 due to different scoring methodology.
Recalculated for consistency: 172 raw / 24 weight = 7.2 average score
```

### A5: Break-Even Analysis

```
Monthly Fixed Costs: $500
Target Monthly Gross Profit: $2,500 (for $30K annual net profit)
Required Monthly Revenue at 50% margin: $5,000

Break-even clients per year:
- At $20K project, 50% margin = $10K gross profit
- Need 3 projects for $30K annual gross profit
- Current pipeline ($38K) already exceeds annual break-even

Prevyu break-even:
- Monthly cost: $200 (hosting, tools)
- At $39/user, need 6 paying users to cover costs
- At 100 users: $3,900 MRR - $200 costs = $3,700 profit/month
```

## Final Note

This analysis provides a framework for decision-making, not a prescription. The weighted matrix and financial projections are based on stated assumptions that should be validated through execution. The hybrid approach (Option 4) emerges as the recommended path because it:

1. Preserves the proven consulting revenue stream
2. Provides structured validation for the high-upside Prevyu opportunity
3. Eliminates the distraction of OfferPath
4. Aligns with the founder's stated priorities (time, margins, probability)
5. Creates clear decision points rather than indefinite experimentation

The 60-day Prevyu validation sprint will provide the data needed to make a definitive bet in Q2 2026. Until then, the hybrid approach maximizes learning while minimizing downside risk.
