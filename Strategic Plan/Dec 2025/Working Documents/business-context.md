## Executive Summary

ScaleUp Ventures is a 1.5-year-old business consulting firm with development capabilities, operating a "studio model" that combines client services with proprietary product development. The company has generated ~$50K in revenue from 4-5 clients but faces margin challenges (23% gross, 3% net) due to early-stage pricing pressure and inconsistent cost management. The founder seeks to reach $100K in 2026 with high margins and minimal personal time involvement, as a stepping stone toward financial independence and a portfolio of scalable assets.

## Market Analysis

### Target Customers (Consulting)
- Small-to-mid-sized businesses
- Investment capacity of $20,000+/year
- Serious about growth, not looking for cheap solutions
- Decisive decision-makers who value ROI
- Often enter through development needs, then expand scope

### Competitive Landscape

| Aspect | Current State |
|--------|---------------|
| **Known Competitors** | Not specifically identified (research needed) |
| **Win Factors** | Competence, experience, trust, demonstrated value |
| **Positioning** | Trust-based differentiation, not price or niche |
| **Key Differentiator** | ROI-focused selling with accountability metrics |

### Market Trends

### Market Position

---

## SWOT Assessment

### Strengths
- Proven ability to win and deliver client work
- Strong technical capabilities (web dev, app dev)
- Compelling differentiator (ROI-focused, accountability metrics)
- Natural cross-sell flywheel (dev → growth → process improvement)
- Capable team available (ads, dev, marketing/sales)
- Low fixed costs and overhead
- Founder has W-2 stability (not desperate)
- AI-driven delivery increases margins when applied

### Weaknesses

- No proactive business development
- No strategic planning discipline
- Cash-poor currently ($1,400)
- No existing audience or email list
- Time trapped in delivery (20-30 hrs/week)
- Too dependent on one client for revenue
- Products consuming time without revenue

### Opportunities
- Prevyu: High-margin SaaS if market validates (90%+ margins)
- Systematize consulting for consistent 50% margins
- Use paid ads for consulting lead gen to reduce referral dependency
- Leverage Roe for paid acquisition (cost = ads only)
- AI/automation positioning aligns with market trends
- $19K profit pipeline provides runway for strategic moves

### Threats
- Cash constraints limit experimentation
- Products may not validate, consuming scarce time
- Continued margin erosion if pricing discipline not implemented
- Single client dependency creates revenue risk
- Founder burnout from delivery + products + strategy

- **Validation**: Prove ability to execute at scale

### 3-Year Vision

4. Client concentration (reduce single-client dependency)
5. Recurring revenue (if Prevyu validates)

## Current Decision Context

### The Core Question
**What is the highest probability path to $100K in 2026 with the least founder time and highest margins?**

### Options Under Consideration

#### Option 1: Double Down on Consulting
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Description** | Systematize and scale the proven consulting business |
| **Potential Upside** | Proven demand, 40-50% margins achievable, predictable |
| **Concerns/Risks** | Requires ongoing biz dev, founder time, not passive |
| **Previous Experience** | Has worked - $50K generated, clients satisfied |

#### Option 2: Bet on Prevyu (SaaS)
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Description** | Focus resources on validating and scaling Prevyu |
| **Potential Upside** | 90%+ margins, minimal human involvement, scalable |
| **Concerns/Risks** | Unproven market, may not validate, opportunity cost |
| **Previous Experience** | Product built, not yet launched to paying users |

#### Option 3: Continue OfferPath Development
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Description** | Continue investing in OfferPath validation |
| **Potential Upside** | Large job seeker market if product-market fit exists |
| **Concerns/Risks** | Market and margin model both uncertain, team has doubts |
| **Previous Experience** | Launched, running ads, no customers yet |

#### Option 4: Hybrid Approach
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Description** | Consulting for cash flow + time-boxed Prevyu validation |
| **Potential Upside** | De-risked approach, multiple shots on goal |
| **Concerns/Risks** | Divided attention, slower progress on each path |
| **Previous Experience** | Current approach (but without strategic discipline) |

## Resources & Constraints

### Available Resources

**Team (Subcontractors)**
| Name | Capability | Strategic Value |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| Roe | Paid ads | Can run ads at cost (no markup) |
| Patrick | Developer | Execution capacity for dev work |
| Aaron | Developer | Execution capacity for dev work |
| Ray | Marketing strategy, operations, sales | Great salesperson - can drive biz dev |

**Financial**
- Current cash: $1,400
- Monthly retainer: $800/month ongoing
- Fixed-bid contract: $38,000 over 6 months (~$19K profit)
- Monthly expenses: ~$500
- Founder W-2 job provides personal stability
- Willing to invest in ScaleUp once things are proven

**Other Assets**
- LinkedIn presence (untapped)
- Prevyu product (ready to launch)
- OfferPath product (built)
- ROI-focused methodology (differentiator)

### Key Constraints
- Cash-poor currently (limits experimentation)
- No existing audience or email list
- Founder time: 20-30 hours/week (wants to reduce)
- No minimum income required from ScaleUp (covers expenses, don't lose money)

### Non-Negotiables
- None identified - founder is open to any approach that achieves goals

---

## Decision Criteria

When evaluating options, the founder prioritizes (in order):

1. **Founder time required** - Must minimize personal involvement in operations
2. **Margin potential** - High margins essential (target 50%+)
3. **Probability of success** - Prefers proven over speculative
4. **Scalability** - Path to $1M must exist
5. **Validation status** - Willing to invest once things are proven
6. **Cash requirements** - Limited upfront investment capacity

### Decision-Making Style
- Data-informed but resource-constrained
- Values ROI and accountability metrics
- Pragmatic - will deprioritize unproven paths
- Long-term thinker (building toward financial independence)

---

## Information Gaps

Areas requiring further research or analysis:

1. **Competitive landscape** - Specific competitors not identified
2. **Prevyu market size** - Day trader TAM and willingness to pay unknown
3. **OfferPath viability** - Market validation still inconclusive
4. **Consulting pricing optimization** - What price points maximize margin without losing deals?
5. **Ideal client profile** - More data needed (only 4-5 clients to date)
6. **LinkedIn audience value** - Unknown if existing connections are monetizable

---

## Additional Context

### Time Allocation (Current State)
1. Client delivery - Bulk of time
2. Product development (Prevyu, OfferPath) - Second
3. Operations/admin - Third
4. Business development - Virtually none (~1 hr/month, reactive)
5. Strategic thinking/planning - Non-existent

### Margin Insights
- Some projects achieved 50% margin (when AI used, pricing right)
- Others were very low margin
- Variable profitability due to lack of pricing discipline
- G&A overspent in year one
- Direct costs not managed tightly

### Client Acquisition (Current)
- 100% referrals and network
- No outbound or inbound marketing
- Marketing capability now available (Roe for ads)
- Key question: What to market?

### Engagement Patterns
- Best: AI-delivered work, clear ROI shown upfront
- Worst: Indecisive client (still high margin, but painful)
- All clients satisfied overall

---

## Strategic Recommendations (Preliminary)

Based on discovery findings:

### 1. Deprioritize OfferPath
Market and margin model both uncertain. Park until clarity exists on other paths.

### 2. Time-Boxed Prevyu Validation
Run a focused 30-60 day validation:
- Use Roe for targeted ads to day trader communities
- Launch free cohort as planned
- Define success criteria upfront (X users, Y engagement, Z willingness to pay)
- Go/no-go decision at end of validation period

### 3. Systematize Consulting for Margin Improvement
- Establish minimum project size ($15K+?)
- Create pricing floor and stick to it
- Define ideal client criteria (decisive, $20K+ capacity, values ROI)
- Leverage AI in delivery to hit 50% margins consistently
- Document and templatize the ROI-modeling approach

### 4. Activate Ray for Business Development
- Reduce referral dependency
- Proactive pipeline generation
- Use the ROI-focused differentiator in outreach

### 5. Institute Strategic Planning Rhythm
- Even 2 hours/week would transform decision-making
- Monthly margin review
- Quarterly goal assessment
