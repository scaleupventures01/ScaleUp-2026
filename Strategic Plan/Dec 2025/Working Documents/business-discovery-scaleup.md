**Date:** December 30, 2025

---

## Company Overview

**Q: What is your business name, and what industry are you in?**

A: ScaleUp Ventures (https://scaleupventures.co/) is the parent company. We also have two MVP products:
- Prevyu (https://prevyu.co/)
- OfferPath (https://www.offerpath.co/)

ScaleUp is a business consulting firm that can also build apps, operating in the consulting/agency space.

---

**Q: What services does ScaleUp provide?**

A: Five service lines:
1. **Growth Services** - Marketing, branding help
2. **Development** - Websites and web apps
3. **Process Improvement** - AI, automation, AI agents to make companies more scalable and profitable
4. **Startup Fundraising** - Helping companies raise capital and position themselves for fundraising
5. **Acquisition/Roll-up** - Buying mom-and-pop shops and smaller firms to roll them up

**Current Status:** Not everything has gotten fully off the ground - some starts but time is limited.

---

**Q: In 2-3 sentences, how would you describe what ScaleUp Ventures does for its clients? What's the primary problem you solve, and for whom?**

A: ScaleUp leverages expertise in growth marketing, app development, fundraising, and automation as **tools to help businesses reach their goals**.

**Target Market:** Smaller to mid-sized firms with capacity to spend at least **$20,000/year** on growing and investing in their firm.

---

**Q: Are Prevyu and OfferPath client-facing products, internal tools, or separate business ventures?**

A: They are **B2C products** created as part of a "studio" model - ScaleUp wants to be a consulting firm that also makes and rolls out their own products.

---

## Financial Position

**Q: How long has ScaleUp Ventures been operating, and what's your approximate annual revenue?**

A:
- **Business Age:** ~1.5 years old
- **2024 Revenue:** ~$50,000 from 4-5 clients (average ~$10-12.5K per client)
- **Gross Profit Margin:** 23%
- **Net Profit Margin:** 3%

**2026 Goals:**
- Increase both margins
- Reach $100,000 in revenue (2x growth target)

---

**Q: What's eating into your margins? (Pricing, delivery costs, overhead, scope creep?)**

A: Combination of **pricing and delivery costs**.

Details:
- **Undercharging in first year** - "taking what we can get"
- **Trying to keep clients** (possibly over-servicing or discounting)
- **Outsourcing/subcontractors** cut into revenue
- **Core thesis:** Leverage AI to become more efficient and profitable
- **Fixed costs are low**
- **Projects complete on time and successfully**

**Margin Variability:**
- Some projects hit ~50% margin
- Others were very low margin
- Inconsistent project profitability

**Root Causes Identified:**
- Overspent on G&A in first year
- Didn't manage direct costs as well as possible

**Key Insight:** The business model works (50% margins are achievable) - the challenge is consistency and discipline in pricing and cost management.

---

## Team Structure

**Q: Is it just you, or do you have partners/employees? When you use subcontractors, is that for specific capabilities or capacity overflow?**

A:
- **Solo founder/operator**
- Uses **subcontractors as needed for specific capabilities** (strategic, not overflow)
- Would like to **retain subcontractors** when assigned to contracts, projects, or products (OfferPath, Prevyu)

**Model:** Hub and spoke - founder is the rainmaker, strategist, and project lead with specialized subcontractors for execution.

---

## Go-to-Market

**Q: How are you currently finding and winning clients?**

A:
- **Referrals and word-of-mouth**
- **Network and past relationships**
- **No outbound or inbound marketing currently**

**New Development:** Now have a team member who can run ads for virtually free (just cost of ads). Interested in running ads in the future, but want to determine the best thing to market first - which is the purpose of this discovery process.

---

## Service Line Strategy & Cross-Selling

**Q: Which service lines have you delivered work in? How do they relate to each other?**

A: Have done work across all service lines to varying degrees:

**Core Cross-Sell Model:**
- Client comes in for **Development** (build an app)
- Naturally inquire about **Growth** - "How are you growing? Can you grow faster?"
- **Process Improvement** often ties in because improving processes usually requires improving something public-facing (development)
- Focus on delivering **ROI** - "Let's grow your business while we do this"

**Development ↔ Growth ↔ Process Improvement = Core integrated offering**

**Service Lines with Concerns:**

1. **Startup Fundraising** - Concerned because it creates dependency on:
   - External market conditions
   - The client's ability to execute/sell
   - Market reception to their idea
   - **Not a priority focus area**

2. **Acquisition/Roll-up** - Got down to LOI on deals, but:
   - Funding was a challenge
   - Deals weren't great at the time
   - **Still interested - needs to figure out the best approach**

---

## Competitive Landscape

**Q: Who are your top 2-3 competitors? What made clients choose you over them?**

A:
- **Competitors:** Unknown - needs research
- **Why clients choose ScaleUp:**
  - Competent
  - Experienced
  - Trustworthy
  - Demonstrate real value
  - Show they can do a good job

**Differentiation:** Trust and proven competence, not price or specific niche positioning.

---

## Engagement Patterns (Ideal Client Signals)

**Q: Which engagements worked best (highest margin, smoothest delivery, most satisfied, easiest to win)? Which were most painful?**

**Best Engagements - Common Traits:**
- All clients have been satisfied overall
- **Highest margin:** Projects where AI was used to do the work
- **Core strength:** Project-based web dev and app dev - very comfortable there
- **Easiest to win:** Deals where they can show **clear ROI upfront**
  - Build a model showing how client makes money back before spending a dollar
  - Define metrics client can hold them accountable to during engagement
  - **ROI-focused selling is a key differentiator**

**Worst Engagement:**
- Client who couldn't make decisions - went back and forth on what they wanted
- Still high margin, but progress stalled due to client indecision
- Root cause unclear: communication issue or client disengagement
- **Note:** Sample size too small to draw definitive conclusions

**Emerging Ideal Client Profile:**
- Decisive decision-makers
- Value ROI-focused approach
- Need web/app development
- Open to cross-sell into growth and process improvement

---

## Time Allocation & Constraints

**Q: How are you currently spending your time? Where are you most stretched/bottlenecked?**

**Current Time Allocation (approximate):**
1. **Client delivery** - Bulk of time (highest priority)
2. **Product development** (Prevyu, OfferPath) - Second priority
3. **Operations/admin** - Third
4. **Business development** - Virtually none (~1 hour/month or every other week, reactive only)
5. **Strategic thinking/planning** - Non-existent

**Critical Insight:**
- No proactive business development = relying entirely on inbound/referrals
- No strategic planning = "took on what we did" without attention to metrics
- Didn't track margins/percentages until end of year
- This explains the inconsistent margins and "taking what we can get" pattern

**Bottleneck:** Time is going to delivery and products, leaving no capacity for the activities that drive growth (biz dev) or profitability (strategic planning, pricing discipline).

---

## Products (Studio Model)

**Q: What does Prevyu and OfferPath do? Who are they for? What's their status?**

### Prevyu (https://prevyu.co/)
**What it does:** Pre-trade discipline platform that analyzes potential trades against a user's personal rules BEFORE execution, providing GO/WAIT/NO-GO signals to prevent rule-breaking trades.

**Target Audience:** Day traders and active traders who struggle with execution discipline despite having sound strategies. Traders who know their rules but fail to follow them consistently.

**Problem Solved:** "90% of traders fail because they break their own rules." Traditional post-trade journals only document failures after losses occur - Prevyu intervenes BEFOREHAND.

**Key Features:**
- Pre-trade checkpoints with three-signal system (GO/WAIT/NO-GO)
- Rule-based analysis checking against user-defined A+ setup criteria
- Performance tracking (174+ decisions monitored)
- AI coaching cards with personalized insights on performance, behavior, and risk
- Real-time guidance based on daily loss limits, risk/reward ratios, emotional state

**Pricing Model:** Currently "100% Free for Cohort One" - freemium model with eventual paid tiers expected

**Status:** Ready to launch, planning to have users try it out

---

### OfferPath (https://www.offerpath.co/)
**What it does:** Career Readiness Assessment tool - helps job seekers find their path to interviews

**Target Audience:** Job seekers looking to improve their interview readiness

**Problem Solved:** Career preparation and interview readiness guidance

**Status:**
- Built and launched
- Started paid ads to validate market
- **No revenue yet, no customers yet**
- **Team is unsure if there's a market at a price point that makes sense**

---

### Product Summary

| Product | Target | Status | Revenue | Traction |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| Prevyu | Day traders | Ready to launch | $0 | None yet |
| OfferPath | Job seekers | Launched, testing ads | $0 | Testing market |

**Key Concern:** Both products consuming development time but neither generating revenue. OfferPath market validation underway but uncertain.

---

## 2026 Strategic Goals & Decision

**Q: What's the strategic decision you're wrestling with most for 2026?**

**Primary Goal:**
- **$100K revenue** in 2026 (2x growth)
- **High margins**
- **Minimal personal time involvement** - wants to eventually not be involved in day-to-day operations
- Services and products that don't require a lot of founder time

**The Core Question:** What is the highest probability path to $100K revenue with the least amount of founder time and highest margins?

---

### Margin Estimates by Line of Business

| Business Line | Est. Margin | Time Requirement | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| Marketing Services | 50%+ | Low - outsource to marketer | Ready to outsource |
| Web Dev | 40-50% | Medium - can outsource or do self | Comfortable either way |
| Prevyu (SaaS) | 90%+ | Very Low - AI, no human involvement | Highest margin potential |
| OfferPath | ~40%? | Uncertain | Struggling with margin model, uncertain if viable |

---

### Key Observations

**Best margin + lowest time = Prevyu** (if market validates)
- 90%+ margin
- AI-driven, minimal human involvement
- But: unproven market, $0 revenue, needs validation

**Most proven revenue = Consulting (Marketing + Web Dev)**
- Already generating $50K/year
- Can achieve 40-50% margins with better pricing/outsourcing
- Can outsource both marketing and web dev work
- But: requires continued business development

**Most uncertain = OfferPath**
- Margin model unclear
- Market validation in progress but uncertain
- Team unsure if viable at workable price point

---

## Resources & Capabilities

**Q: Are there any resources, capabilities, or assets we haven't discussed?**

### Team Members (Subcontractors)
| Name | Role/Capability |
|------|-----------------|
| Roe | Paid ads |
| Patrick | Developer |
| Aaron | Developer |
| Ray | Marketing strategy, operations, sales |

### Audiences & Communities
- No existing email lists they'd feel comfortable emailing
- Has done community engagement before (LinkedIn) but uncertain about tapping those resources now

### Financial Position

**Current Cash:** $1,400

**Incoming Revenue:**
- Monthly retainer: $800/month (ongoing)
- Fixed-bid contract: $38,000 over next 6 months
  - ~$19,000 profit (50% margin)
  - Contingent on continued performance

**Monthly Expenses:** ~$500/month

**Additional Resource:**
- Founder has W-2 job providing personal income
- Willing to invest in business once things are proven

### Cash Flow Projection (Next 6 Months)

| Month | Retainer | Fixed Contract | Expenses | Net Cash Flow |
|-------|----------|----------------|----------|---------------|
| Monthly | $800 | ~$6,333 | -$500 | ~$6,633 |
| 6-Month Total | $4,800 | $38,000 | -$3,000 | ~$39,800 gross |

**Profit from pipeline:** ~$19,000 from fixed contract + ~$2,400 from retainer (at 50% margin) = ~$21,000+ potential profit over 6 months

---

## Constraints & Non-Negotiables

**Q: Any non-negotiables or constraints for 2026?**

**Financial Constraints:**
- No minimum income required from ScaleUp
- Main goal: Cover expenses, don't lose money, don't have to put money into the business each month
- Anything above breakeven is a bonus

**Time Constraints:**
- Currently spending 20-30 hours/week (including Prevyu and OfferPath)
- Would like to reduce that
- Open to flexibility

**Other Constraints:**
- None - open to all industries, client types, business models
- No personal factors or timeline pressures

---

## The Bigger Picture (Vision)

**Q: If we achieve $100K at high margins with low time involvement - what does that unlock?**

**Immediate Impact:**
1. **Validation** - Proves founder's will and ability to execute
2. **Personal debt payoff** - Better personal financial position
3. **Double down** - Continue to scale and grow

**Long-term Vision:**
- Scale to **$1M** (but must hit $100K first)
- **Buy businesses** (acquisition/roll-up strategy)
- Build **portfolio of products, revenue streams, and services**
- **Reduce client dependency** (currently too dependent on single client)
- Eventually: **Quit W-2 job, retire wife, take care of kids**

**Key Insight:** This isn't just about $100K - it's about building a foundation for financial independence and a scalable asset portfolio. The business is the long-term play.
