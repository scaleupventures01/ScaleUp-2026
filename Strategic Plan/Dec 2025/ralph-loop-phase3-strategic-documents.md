# Ralph Loop: Phase 3 - Strategic Documents Rewrite

### Phrases to FIND and REPLACE

| Find (Old Audience) | Replace With (New Audience) |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| "You've been burned by agencies" | "You want to see proof before you commit" |
| "technology laggards" | "growth-focused owners" |
| "can't modernize themselves" | "too time-constrained to implement" |
| "I've been burned before" | "I need to see the numbers first" |
| "fear of technology" | "focused on what matters" |
| "exit planning" | "growth planning" |
| "sell for more later" | "scale faster now" |
| "modernize or be left behind" | "capture opportunity before competitors" |
| "decades of hard work" | "building something valuable" |

- ROI-first language
- Premium pricing justification
- Heron symbolism and narrative
- Navy/Gold brand identity references

## Execution Process

```
FOR each document (1-4):
    1. Read current document
    2. Identify old-audience language patterns
    3. Contextually rewrite (NOT find/replace):
       a. Transform fear-based framing → growth-based framing
       b. Update demographic references (30-55)
       c. Shift from "can't do tech" → "too busy to implement"
       d. Change exit/legacy focus → scale/growth focus
       e. Update test phrases ("60-year-old" → "45-year-old")
    4. Verify proof-first positioning preserved
    5. Write updated document
    6. Log changes made
    7. Mark document complete
END FOR
```

## Definition of Done

A document is COMPLETE when:
- [ ] All old-audience language replaced with new-audience framing
- [ ] No "burned by agencies", "technology laggard", "55+", "exit planning" language
- [ ] No "60-year-old" test phrases (should be "45-year-old")
- [ ] Growth/scaling motivation prominent
- [ ] Time-constrained (not tech-incompetent) positioning
- [ ] Proof-first messaging preserved
- [ ] Consistent with Phase 1 & 2 completed documents

---

## Validation Checklist

After all 4 documents are complete, run these verification checks:

```bash
# Should return 0 results
grep -ri "burned by agencies\|technology laggard\|55-65\|50-65\|can't modernize\|exit planning\|60-year-old" "Strategic Plan/Dec 2025/Deliverables/"

# Should return multiple results showing new audience language
grep -ri "30-55\|growth-focused\|time-constrained\|scale\|competitive\|45-year-old" "Strategic Plan/Dec 2025/Deliverables/"
```

---

## Completion Promise

When Phase 3 is complete, output:

```
<promise>PHASE3_STRATEGIC_DOCUMENTS_COMPLETE</promise>
```

This signals readiness for user review before proceeding to Phase 4 (Industry Personas).

## Progress Tracker

| # | Document | Read | Transformed | Verified |
|---|----------|------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | brand-positioning-framework.md | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |

## Notes

- This is CONTEXTUAL rewriting, not mechanical find/replace
- Read Phase 1 & 2 completed documents for tone reference
- Preserve all strategic value while updating audience framing
- When in doubt, ask: "Would a 40-year-old CEO scaling their company find this compelling?"
- Maintain document structure and formatting
- Some documents may be working drafts with informal notes - preserve the working nature while updating language
