## Section 5: What They Value in Partners

### 5.1 ROI Positioning - The Differentiation

> **Critical Nuance: Claim vs. Capability**
> "Important distinction: 'ROI-focused' as a claim is overused - nearly every agency says it. The differentiation is in the capability:
> - What everyone claims: 'We're ROI-focused' (cliche, meaningless)
> - What <5% actually do: Build pre-engagement ROI models using client's real data
> - What <10% offer: Any form of accountability or guarantee tied to projections
>
> Your differentiation lever: Lean into the mechanism ('we build a model showing how you make your money back before you spend a dollar') rather than the buzzword ('we're ROI-focused'). The specificity is the moat."
> [Source: persona-research-report.html, ROI Positioning Validation]

### 5.2 Rarity Confirmation

> **RARITY CONFIRMED:**
> - Web Dev Agencies: <5% offer ROI models
> - Marketing Agencies: 1-5% performance-based
> - SMB Consulting: 0 firms found offering this
> - ROI Guarantees: <10% offer any guarantee
> - Industry Standard: 70%+ deliverables-based
> [Source: persona-research-report.html, ROI Validation Section]

### 5.3 Trust Requirements

**Why Insurance (and Similar Laggard Industries) Ignore Competition:**
> "Competitors ignore this market because:
> - Seen as 'old school' and slow-moving
> - Requires patience and hand-holding
> - Not 'sexy' like startups
> BUT: loyal, have budget, refer generously"
> [Source: persona-research-report.html, Insurance Agencies Section]

## Section 6: Anti-Personas (Who NOT to Target)

> - No revenue yet
> [Source: persona-research-report.html, Anti-Personas Section]

### 6.2 The Price Shopper

> **Description:** Comparing you to Fiverr/Upwork. Values cost over outcome.
>

> [Source: persona-research-report.html, Anti-Personas Section]

### 6.4 The $20-50K Revenue Startup

>
> **Red Flags:**

> - No funding raised
> - "We'll have budget once we grow"
> [Source: persona-research-report.html, Anti-Personas Section]

### 6.5 Industries to Deprioritize

> **Do NOT Prioritize These:**
> "Restaurants (46), Fitness/Gyms (46): Wrong demographics (avg age 37-39), insufficient budgets (67% spend <$500/mo), and saturated competition (Toast, Mindbody). These industries do not fit the ScaleUp thesis."
> [Source: persona-similarity-analysis.html, Priority Order Section]

## Summary: Brand Strategy Implications

### Core Brand Positioning

ScaleUp Ventures should position as:

**"The ROI-First Technology Partner for Technology Laggard Industries"**

Key differentiators to emphasize:
1. **Pre-engagement ROI modeling** (<5% of competitors offer this)
2. **Industry specialization** (technology laggards 50-65 years old)
3. **Accountability and transparency** (addresses "burned by agencies" pain)
4. **Exit value enhancement** (succession planning angle)

### Priority Audience Sequence

1. **Staffing Agencies** (67/80) - Fastest sales cycle, highest urgency
2. **Veterinary Practices** (65/80) - Clear PE threat, strong budgets
3. **Pest Control** (64/80) - Recurring revenue, national chain pressure
4. **Trades Super-Cluster** (63/80) - Largest combined market
5. **Insurance Agencies** (62/80) - Technology laggard archetype
6. **Professional Services** (62/80) - Relationship-driven buying
7. **New Legal** (58/80) - Results guarantee entry point

### Messaging Hierarchy

1. **Lead with outcomes** ("See how you'll make your money back before you spend a dollar")
2. **Address the wound** ("We know you've been burned by agencies before")
3. **Show industry understanding** (Use their terminology, cite their associations)
4. **Build through trust signals** (Case studies, client references, clear pricing)
