| **Primary Motivation** | Fear of being left behind, Exit planning | Growth & competitive edge, Scaling |
| **Tech Relationship** | Technology laggards, Can't do it themselves | Technology-cautious, Time-poor, Strategic delegators |

### Phrases to FIND and REPLACE

| Find (Old Audience) | Replace With (New Audience) |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| "You've been burned by agencies" | "You want to see proof before you commit" |
| "technology laggards" | "growth-stage owners" |
| "can't modernize themselves" | "too time-constrained to implement" |
| "I've been burned before" | "I need to see the numbers first" |
| "fear of technology" | "focused on what matters" |
| "exit planning" | "growth planning" |
| "sell for more later" | "scale faster now" |
| "modernize or be left behind" | "capture opportunity before competitors" |
| "decades of hard work" | "building something valuable" |
| "didn't grow up with technology" | "too busy running operations" |
| "hand-holding" | "execution capacity" |
| "older business owners" | "growth-focused owners" |
| "55-60" or "50-65" | "30-55" |

### PRESERVE These Elements

- ROI-first language
- Premium pricing justification
- Heron symbolism and narrative
- Navy/Gold brand identity references

## Execution Process

```
FOR each document (1-10):
    1. Read current document
    2. Identify old-audience language patterns
    3. Contextually rewrite (NOT find/replace):
       a. Transform fear-based framing → growth-based framing
       b. Update demographic references (30-55)
       c. Shift from "can't do tech" → "too busy to implement"
       d. Change exit/legacy focus → scale/growth focus
    4. Verify proof-first positioning preserved
    5. Write updated document
    6. Log changes made
    7. Mark document complete
END FOR
```

## Notes

- This is CONTEXTUAL rewriting, not mechanical find/replace
- Read Phase 1 completed documents for tone reference
- Preserve all strategic value while updating audience framing
- When in doubt, ask: "Would a 40-year-old CEO scaling their company find this compelling?"
- Maintain document structure and formatting
