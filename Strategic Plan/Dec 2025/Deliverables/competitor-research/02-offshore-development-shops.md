# Competitive Research: Offshore Development Shops

**Research Date:** December 31, 2025
**Target Company:** ScaleUp Ventures
**Research Focus:** Offshore/nearshore development companies competing on price in SMB web/app development

---

## Executive Summary

This research identifies 15+ named offshore development competitors across India, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Philippines. Key findings:

- **India** offers the lowest rates ($15-49/hr) with largest talent pools but highest quality variance
- **Eastern Europe** (Poland, Ukraine) provides best quality-to-price ratio ($30-75/hr) with strong technical skills
- **Latin America** offers nearshore advantages with US timezone alignment ($25-60/hr)
- **Philippines** provides English proficiency advantage at competitive rates ($25-45/hr)

**Strategic Insight for ScaleUp:** Offshore shops compete primarily on labor arbitrage. ScaleUp's value proposition should emphasize:
1. Reduced hidden costs (communication overhead, rework, management burden)
2. Strategic partnership vs. task execution
3. Accountability and outcome-based engagement
4. Integrated Growth Marketing + Development approach (unique differentiator)
