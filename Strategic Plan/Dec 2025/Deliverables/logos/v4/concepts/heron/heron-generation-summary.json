I wait. I strike with precision.\" This is exactly what ScaleUp Ventures does for clients. The heron is the anti-consultant - patient, observant, precise. Not the frantic energy of a hawk, but the calculated stillness of a master.\n\nDESIGN DIRECTION:\nAbstract the heron to 3-5 geometric shapes MAXIMUM. This is the Saul Bass approach - find the ONE geometric truth that captures the entire bird's spirit.\n\nTHE SACRED ELEMENT:\nThe elegant S-curve of the heron's neck is SACRED - this curved line is the visual hook, the memorable gesture. One continuous flowing line that moves like water but feels solid as steel.\n\nGEOMETRY:\n- The neck: A single elegant curve, perhaps rendered as a flowing thick line or a thin crescent form\n- The body: A single geometric shape - triangle, teardrop, or abstract wedge\n- Maximum 4 total elements including the eye\n- The silhouette should be recognizable at a GLANCE, memorable after ONE viewing\n\nGOLD ACCENT - USE SPARINGLY:\n- ONLY on the eye (a perfect small circle) OR the beak tip (a subtle point)\n- Like a glint of sunlight on still water\n- This tiny gold detail (#D4A853) should feel PRECIOUS, not decorative\n\nTYPOGRAPHY BELOW THE MARK:\n\"ScaleUp Ventures\" in a refined serif typeface (like Crimson Pro or Freight Display)\n- Tracked with elegant letterspacing\n- Deep Navy (#0F1729) color\n- Positioned below the mark with appropriate breathing room\n- The type should feel carved in marble, not printed\n\nEMOTIONAL IMPACT:\nWhen a skeptical 60-year-old CEO sees this logo, they should feel:\n\"These people are serious. They're patient. They don't rush. I can trust them.\"\n\nRENDER AS:\nProfessional logo mark with wordmark, flat vector style, pure white background. The aesthetic of a century-old institution combined with timeless modern design."

This is their final masterwork - ONE fluid stroke that captures the bird's entire essence. Years of practice distilled into a single gesture.\n\nDESIGN DIRECTION:\nThe entire heron rendered as ONE continuous line that never lifts from the page. The line flows from beak tip, curves elegantly through the S-shaped neck, sweeps through the body, and extends through the leg to a single point.\n\nTHE LINE:\n- Varying thickness to suggest form - thinner at extremities, fuller at the body\n- Navy blue (#0F1729) - solid, confident, unwavering\n- The curve of the neck is the HERO of this design\n- Organic flow with geometric precision - it feels natural but is mathematically perfect\n\nGOLD ACCENT - THE EYE:\n- A single perfect gold circle (#D4A853) marking the eye position\n- This is the ONLY departure from the continuous stroke\n- Positioned precisely where the curve of the head meets the neck line\n- Small but luminous - like a drop of molten gold\n\nTHE OVERALL SHAPE:\n- Should suggest the heron in elegant stillness - standing, watching, waiting\n- The single leg implied by the line descending to a point\n- Height-to-width ratio approximately 3:1 (tall and elegant)\n\nTYPOGRAPHY:\n\"ScaleUp Ventures\" below the mark\n- Elegant serif with generous letter-spacing\n- Navy blue (#0F1729)\n- The wordmark should feel like it belongs with this brushstroke aesthetic\n- Perhaps slightly lighter weight than the mark itself\n\nMOOD:\nThe confidence that comes from mastery. The patience of wisdom.

Every angle is intentional. Every proportion is calculated. The result is a silhouette so refined it feels like a building as much as a bird.\n\nDESIGN DIRECTION:\nA solid navy silhouette of an abstract heron, but with ARCHITECTURAL precision:\n- Sharp, deliberate angles where curves might typically be\n- The neck as a series of 2-3 connected straight segments forming an elegant angle\n- The body as a confident geometric mass\n- No organic flourishes - this is ENGINEERED beauty\n\nGEOMETRY:\n- The beak: A precise narrow triangle pointing forward\n- The head: A small geometric form (circle or angular shape)\n- The neck: Angular, like an elegant bracket or architectural detail\n- The body: A bold, solid mass - perhaps trapezoidal or wedge-shaped\n- Total silhouette should read clearly at any size\n\nNEGATIVE SPACE:\n- Consider using negative space within the form\n- Perhaps the eye is created by absence rather than addition\n- Clean, crisp edges throughout\n\nGOLD ACCENT:\n- The eye: A perfect gold (#D4A853) circle, small and precise\n- OR: The tip of the beak in gold - a golden point of precision\n- This accent should feel like inlaid metal, precious and permanent\n\nTYPOGRAPHY:\n\"ScaleUp Ventures\" in a geometric serif (like Playfair Display or similar)\n- Strong, confident letterforms\n- Navy blue (#0F1729)\n- Tracking should echo the precision of the mark\n\nMOOD:\nEngineering confidence.

How few elements can suggest a heron while still evoking patience, precision, and watchfulness? This is the logo that makes people look twice - abstract enough to intrigue, clear enough to remember.\n\nDESIGN DIRECTION:\nThe absolute minimum required to suggest \"heron\":\n- Perhaps just the distinctive curved neck and a suggestion of the head\n- Or the characteristic standing posture reduced to geometric essence\n- The goal: when someone sees this, they FEEL \"heron\" before they consciously identify it\n\nPOSSIBLE APPROACHES:\n1. Just the curved neck line and a gold circle eye - nothing more\n2. A vertical stance with elegant S-curve suggesting neck and body in one form\n3. Two or three shapes that together create the impression of the bird\n\nTHE CURVE:\n- The signature S-curve of the heron's neck MUST be present in some form\n- This is the DNA of the design - the one element that cannot be removed\n- Thick navy line or elegant crescent shape\n\nGOLD ACCENT - ESSENTIAL:\n- The gold (#D4A853) element should be the eye\n- This single point of gold becomes the anchor of the entire composition\n- Small, perfect, precious - like a gold filling in a navy sky\n\nNEGATIVE SPACE CONSIDERATION:\n- What you leave out matters as much as what you include\n- The white space around the minimal forms should feel intentional\n- Breathing room that suggests patience and confidence\n\nTYPOGRAPHY:\n\"ScaleUp Ventures\" - refined, elegant serif\n- Lighter weight than the mark to create hierarchy\n- Navy (#0F1729)\n- Generous spacing - let it breathe\n\nMOOD:\nSophistication through restraint.

This creates a logo mark that works as a standalone icon - perfect for app icons, social media, stamps, and seals. The circle represents wholeness, completion, the full-service nature of ScaleUp's approach.\n\nDESIGN DIRECTION:\nThe abstract heron integrated with a circular form:\n- The heron might be WITHIN a circle (thin navy ring)\n- Or the heron's curve might COMPLETE the circle\n- Or the circle might frame/contain the heron silhouette\n\nGEOMETRY:\n- Circle: Thin navy (#0F1729) ring, or implied circle\n- Heron: Minimalist navy silhouette or curved form within\n- The heron's S-curve neck should play off the circular form\n- The bird should feel balanced within the containment, not cramped\n\nPOSSIBLE COMPOSITIONS:\n1. Thin circle ring containing an elegant heron silhouette\n2. The heron's curved neck completing 3/4 of a circle, with a thin arc completing it\n3. A solid heron silhouette emerging from or contained by a circle\n\nGOLD ACCENT:\n- The eye of the heron: a small gold (#D4A853) circle\n- This creates a \"circle within a circle\" motif - elegant repetition\n- Or the gold could be a small accent at the point where the heron meets the circle\n\nPROPORTIONS:\n- The overall mark should work as a square icon\n- The heron should feel COMFORTABLE within the circle, not squeezed\n- Leave adequate space for the form to breathe\n\nTYPOGRAPHY:\n\"ScaleUp Ventures\" positioned below the circular mark\n- Elegant serif typeface\n- Navy (#0F1729)\n- Width should relate harmoniously to the circle diameter\n\nMOOD:\nCompleteness.
