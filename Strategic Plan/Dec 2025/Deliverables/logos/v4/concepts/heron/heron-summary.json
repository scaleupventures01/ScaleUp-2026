The heron should be standing in its characteristic patient, observant pose - embodying \"watch before you act.\" Think of it as a heron rendered through the lens of minimalist architecture - just enough shape to recognize, not a detail more.\n\nGEOMETRY:\n- The heron form reduced to 5-7 clean geometric shapes maximum\n- Angular, architectural interpretation - like a heron designed by a modernist architect\n- The characteristic long neck as a single elegant diagonal line or thin triangle\n- Body as a simple angular form (perhaps a chevron or wedge shape)\n- Long legs suggested by two thin vertical lines\n- A single gold (#D4A853) accent element - perhaps the eye, or a subtle highlight on the beak\n- Overall height-to-width ratio approximately 3:1 (tall and elegant)\n\nCOMPOSITION:\n- The geometric heron mark positioned above or to the left of the company name\n- \"ScaleUp Ventures\" in an elegant serif typeface (think: Didot, Bodoni, or Times New Roman Bold)\n- Text in Navy (#0F1729)\n- Clean white background (#FFFFFF)\n\nTHE HERON SYMBOLISM:\nThe heron stands motionless in shallow water, observing with intense focus, then strikes with lightning precision. It embodies \"patience before precision\" - the medieval symbol of nobility, dignity, and self-reliance. This logo should feel like EARNED WISDOM, not eager ambition.\n\nMOOD:\nSomething you'd see etched into frosted glass at a respected advisory firm. The confidence of 40 years of expertise. A logo that a 58-year-old successful business owner would respect and trust - NOT something trendy or startup-esque.\n\nWHAT THIS IS NOT:\n- NOT cute or cartoonish\n- NOT a realistic bird illustration\n- NOT decorative or ornate\n- NOT a tech startup aesthetic\n- NOT something you'd see at a children's zoo\n\nRENDER AS:\nProfessional logo mark with company name, flat vector style, white background. Suitable for business cards, letterhead, and as a small favicon."

The bird should be rendered in profile (side view), with enough detail to clearly recognize the distinctive heron silhouette while maintaining a sophisticated, logo-appropriate level of simplification.\n\nTHE HERON DETAILS:\n- Classic heron profile: long elegant neck in gentle S-curve\n- Sharp, dagger-like beak pointing forward (precision, readiness to act)\n- Distinctive head plume/crest rendered as 2-3 elegant lines\n- Body proportions showing the bird's natural grace\n- Long, thin legs - the heron's patient stance in shallow water\n- Overall feeling: poised, alert, dignified, patient\n\nCOLOR EXECUTION:\n- Primary heron body and outline: Deep Navy (#0F1729)\n- Accent details (eye, beak tip, or subtle leg highlight): Gold (#D4A853)\n- Background: Pure White (#FFFFFF)\n\nCOMPOSITION:\n- The heron mark positioned to the left of or above the company name\n- \"ScaleUp Ventures\" in an elegant serif typeface - sophisticated and timeless\n- Optionally include tagline \"We Prove It Before You Buy\" in smaller text below in a complementary sans-serif\n- All text in Navy (#0F1729)\n\nSYMBOLIC MEANING TO CONVEY:\nThe heron is known for standing motionless for extended periods, watching, waiting, analyzing - then striking with extraordinary precision when the moment is right. This represents: thorough due diligence, patience over impulsiveness, and precision execution. A medieval symbol of nobility, dignity, and self-reliance.\n\nMOOD & FEELING:\nThis should feel like the logo of a firm that doesn't need to chase business - business comes to them because of their reputation. The quiet confidence of proven expertise. Something a skeptical 60-year-old business owner who's been burned by flashy consultants would actually trust.\n\nWHAT TO AVOID:\n- Cartoonish or cute interpretation\n- Overly detailed illustration that won't scale down\n- Generic bird clipart aesthetic\n- Trendy or startup-style design\n- Blue herons (stick with navy silhouette style)\n\nRENDER AS:\nProfessional combination logo (mark + wordmark), vector-style flat design, white background. The mark should work at small sizes (favicon) and large (signage)."

The bird's neck is extended downward with a fish captured in its beak. This is NOT a violent image - it's a dignified representation of PRECISION REWARDED. The patient watching has led to the precise action, and the result is secured success.\n\nTHE DRAMATIC MOMENT:\n- Heron with neck extended in classic \"strike complete\" pose\n- A stylized fish (simple, elegant, not cartoon-y) held in the sharp beak\n- The bird's body angled dynamically but still dignified\n- Head plume flowing back, suggesting the motion just completed\n- Legs may be partially visible, grounded and stable\n\nDESIGN APPROACH:\n- More detailed than a minimal mark, but still LOGO-APPROPRIATE simplification\n- The fish rendered in Gold (#D4A853) - representing the \"golden\" opportunity captured\n- Heron in Navy (#0F1729) - the patient, expert hunter\n- Clean lines, no unnecessary detail, but clearly recognizable scene\n- Think: the sophistication of a Hermes illustration meets modern logo design\n\nCOLOR EXECUTION:\n- Heron body, neck, legs: Deep Navy (#0F1729)\n- Fish: Rich Gold (#D4A853) - the valuable prize\n- Possible gold accent on heron's eye or beak base\n- Background: Pure White (#FFFFFF)\n\nCOMPOSITION:\n- This dynamic mark positioned prominently\n- \"ScaleUp Ventures\" in an elegant, authoritative serif typeface\n- The word \"ScaleUp\" potentially in Navy with \"Ventures\" in a complementary weight\n- Clean arrangement - the mark should be the hero\n\nSYMBOLIC MESSAGE:\n\"We don't just promise results - we deliver them.\" The heron didn't just watch - it captured the prize. This represents: thorough analysis leading to successful execution, the reward of patience and precision, PROVEN RESULTS (aligning with \"We Prove It Before You Buy\").\n\nTHE FEELING:\nThis logo tells a story. It's confident without being arrogant. It shows results without being boastful. A skeptical business owner sees this and thinks: \"These people know how to get things done - they've got the evidence to prove it.\"\n\nWHAT THIS IS NOT:\n- Not aggressive or predatory (this is DIGNIFIED success)\n- Not cartoon or mascot-style\n- Not overly complex illustration\n- Not clip art quality\n- Not cute or whimsical\n\nRENDER AS:\nProfessional logo with maximum impact while maintaining sophistication. Vector-style, flat design, white background. Should work at business card size and on building signage. The most detailed of the three concepts but still cleanly executable as a logo."
