  "prompt": "LEGENDARY LOGO DESIGN - THE CONFRONTATION\n\nCreate a FRONT-FACING LYNX HEAD logo for \"ScaleUp Ventures\" - an elite B2B advisory firm.\n\nTHE CONCEPT - LYNCEUS THE ALL-SEEING:\nIn Greek mythology, the Argonaut Lynceus could \"see through the earth itself.\" This lynx faces you DIRECTLY. There is no hiding. There is no angle. There is only TRUTH. This is the moment when you realize someone can see EVERYTHING about you, and instead of feeling threatened, you feel... relieved. Finally, someone who will tell you the truth.\n\nVISUAL DESIGN - PERFECT BILATERAL SYMMETRY:\n- Full FRONT-FACING lynx head - the viewer is being DIRECTLY confronted\n- Perfect mirror symmetry - left and right sides are IDENTICAL\n- BOTH distinctive tufted ears prominently displayed, rising like twin peaks of authority\n- The face should feel constructed with SACRED GEOMETRY - triangular, angular, precise\n- Distinctive lynx proportions: wide-set eyes, short muzzle, broad cheekbones\n- Cheek ruffs (the lynx's distinctive facial fur) subtly framing the face\n- Angular, triangular face structure tapering to a strong chin\n- The overall head shape should evoke a shield, a crest, an emblem of authority\n\nTHE EYES - THE FOCAL POINT OF POWER:\n- GOLD (#D4A853) eyes that BURN with insight - these are twin suns of discernment\n- Eyes are LEVEL, UNWAVERING, PENETRATING\n- The gaze is not aggressive - it is KNOWING\n- Not threatening - DISCERNING\n- This is a mentor's gaze, a sage's eyes, a trusted advisor's assessment\n- Powerful but wise, commanding but fair\n- The feeling of being truly SEEN by someone who has your best interests at heart\n\nMANDATORY COLOR CONSTRAINTS:\n- Background: PURE WHITE (#FFFFFF) - absolutely no cream, no off-white\n- Primary structural color: Deep Navy (#0F1729) - all lines, shapes, structural elements\n- Accent color: Burnished Gold (#D4A853) - ONLY for the eyes\n- NO gradients\n- NO shadows\n- NO 3D effects\n- FLAT vector-style design only\n\nGEOMETRY AND STYLE:\n- Clean geometric precision - this is not organic or rough\n- Angular forms suggesting strength and mathematical order\n- The triangular ear tufts balance the triangular chin\n- Every line has purpose, every shape is intentional\n- The style of a $100,000 brand identity from Pentagram\n- Must work as a favicon and on a billboard\n\nTYPOGRAPHY:\n\"ScaleUp Ventures\" centered below the lynx head\n- Substantial serif font with gravitas and presence\n- Navy (#0F1729) color matching the lynx\n- Clean, authoritative letterforms\n- The text should feel PROTECTED by the gaze above it\n\nWHAT THIS IS NOT:\n- NOT a cute animal illustration\n- NOT cartoonish or playful\n- NOT aggressive or threatening\n- NOT a generic stock animal icon\n- NOT soft or rounded\n- NOT realistic fur texture\n\nEMOTIONAL IMPACT:\nWhen a CEO who's been lied to by consultants sees this logo, they should feel:\n\"This firm doesn't play games. They will find every hidden truth. They will see what I've been afraid to admit. And that's exactly what I need.\"\n\nThis must feel like looking into the eyes of TRUTH ITSELF.\n\nRENDER AS: Professional flat vector logo, square 1:1 aspect ratio, pure white background, suitable for immediate use as brand identity."
