### 4. REMAINING PLACEHOLDER LINKS

The following links remain as `href="#"` placeholders as they represent:
- Future service-specific pages (not yet created)
- External social media links (would be external URLs)
- Legal pages (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service)
- Contact information display (phone numbers, emails)

These are acceptable and would be updated when:
1. Service-specific landing pages are created
2. Social media URLs are provided
3. Legal pages are created

---

## External Images Status

The design files use:
1. **Embedded Base64 Images** - Generated by Imagen 4 Ultra (no external dependencies)
2. **Unsplash URLs** - For some team photos and case study images (require internet connection)

The Unsplash images are valid public URLs and will load correctly when viewed in a browser with internet access.

## Files After Fix

All 13 design files now:
- Start cleanly with `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- Have correct 2025 copyright year
- Have functional navigation links between pages
- Are ready for browser preview

---

## How to Test

1. Open any design file in a web browser
2. Verify no metadata text appears at top of page
3. Click navigation links to verify they navigate between pages
4. Check footer for correct copyright year (2025)
