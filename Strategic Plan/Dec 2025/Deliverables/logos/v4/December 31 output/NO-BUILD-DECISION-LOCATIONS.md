## Proof Point Hierarchy (Approved)

### Tier 4 PRIMARY: SEC/NFA Financial Trading Platform
**Type:** Capability Proof
**What it proves:** We can build complex, regulated, mission-critical software
**Why it wins:** Highest barrier = highest trust. SEC/NFA compliance is binary, undeniable, and implies all lesser capabilities.

### Tier 4 SECONDARY: Lead Guarantee Results
**Type:** Differentiator Proof
**What it proves:** We stand behind our results with money on the line
**Why it works:** Directly ties to key differentiator. "Money back" is also undeniable.

### Tier 4 TERTIARY: AI Agents Time Savings (20-25 hrs/month)
**Type:** ROI Proof
**What it proves:** Measurable, compounding operational efficiency
**Why it works:** Quantifiable results that grow over time. Relatable to non-technical buyers.

### DEMOTED: The No-Build Decision
**New Role:** Integrity proof for specific contexts only
