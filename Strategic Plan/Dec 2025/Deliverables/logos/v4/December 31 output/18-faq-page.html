                    We help established business owners grow revenue through development, marketing, and AI automation - but only after we prove the numbers work. Unlike agencies that promise results and hope for the best, we build a custom ROI model for your specific situation <em>before</em> you invest a dollar. If the math doesn't show clear returns, we tell you upfront. Our clients typically see 3-5x returns within 12 months.

                    Our clients are established business owners, typically 50-65 years old, running companies with $2M-$50M in annual revenue. They've built something real over decades, they're skeptical of marketing hype, and they've been burned before by agencies that overpromised and underdelivered. They want growth, but they want certainty first. If that sounds like you, we should talk.

Our <strong>"Proof Test"</strong> process builds a detailed ROI model using your actual business data before you commit. We also integrate development, marketing, and AI automation under one roof - no more managing five different vendors who don't talk to each other. And we only take clients where we're confident we can deliver measurable results.

If we can't demonstrate clear ROI, we won't take your money.

                    It starts with a 30-minute discovery call where we learn about your business and goals. If we see potential, we conduct our paid Proof Test analysis (typically 2-3 weeks) where we build your custom ROI model. You then decide whether to proceed based on real numbers. If you move forward, we create a detailed implementation roadmap and begin execution with weekly progress reviews. No surprises, no scope creep.

                    The Proof Test is our signature diagnostic process. We analyze your current operations, revenue streams, customer acquisition costs, and market opportunity. Then we build a detailed projection showing exactly what returns you can expect from each service we recommend. It typically takes 2-3 weeks and costs $2,500. You get the complete analysis to keep regardless of whether you engage us for implementation.

We analyze your current customer acquisition costs, lifetime value, conversion rates, and operational capacity. Then we model conservative, realistic, and optimistic scenarios for each initiative. You see exactly how many new customers, at what cost, generating what revenue. If the conservative scenario doesn't show positive ROI, we tell you.

                    Our minimum implementation engagement is $25,000. This ensures we can deliver meaningful results rather than superficial work. Most clients invest $50,000-$150,000 over 6-12 months across multiple services. The Proof Test, which comes first, is $2,500. We're not the cheapest option - we're the option that proves its value before you commit.

                    The Proof Test takes 2-3 weeks. Implementation timelines vary by scope: a focused website and marketing project typically runs 3-4 months, while comprehensive development plus AI automation can take 6-9 months. We design projects with early wins - you'll see measurable progress within 60-90 days, not at some distant finish line. We also provide clear milestones so you always know where we stand.

                    We implement practical AI that saves time and reduces costs today - not science fiction promises. This includes automated customer communication, intelligent document processing, predictive analytics for inventory or staffing, and workflow automation that eliminates manual data entry. Every AI project starts with clear time or cost savings projections, so you know exactly what you're getting.

                    Yes, though most clients benefit from integrated work. You can engage us for development only, marketing only, or AI automation only. However, the Proof Test often reveals that the biggest ROI comes from combining services - for example, a better website plus targeted advertising plus automated follow-up. We'll show you the numbers for each approach and let you decide.

                    Absolutely. We integrate with your current CRM, ERP, accounting software, and operational tools. Ripping out working systems is expensive and disruptive. We build bridges, not replacements. During the Proof Test, we audit your technology stack and identify the most efficient path forward - sometimes that means keeping what works and adding what's missing.

                    The Proof Test is $2,500. Implementation projects range from $25,000 to $200,000+ depending on scope. Most clients invest $50,000-$150,000 over 6-12 months. We provide exact pricing after the Proof Test, based on your specific needs. We're not the cheapest agency, but we're the one that proves the investment will pay off before you make it.

                    The Proof Test is paid upfront. For implementation projects, we typically structure payments in three phases: 40% to begin, 40% at midpoint milestone, and 20% at completion. For longer engagements, we offer monthly payment plans tied to deliverable milestones. We're flexible on structure - what matters is that payments align with value delivered.

                    We guarantee delivery of what we promise, on timeline and on budget. We don't guarantee specific revenue results because too many factors are outside our control - but that's exactly why we do the Proof Test first. If the numbers don't make sense, we won't take your money. When we do engage, clients consistently see 3-5x returns because we only take projects where we're confident we can deliver.

                    Then we tell you. About 20% of Proof Tests conclude with us advising against engagement - the numbers simply don't justify the investment. You still get the complete analysis (which often reveals other opportunities), and you've invested $2,500 instead of $50,000+ discovering it wouldn't work. That's the whole point of "Certainty First."

                    Everything needed to complete the project. Strategy, design, development, testing, training, and launch support are all included. We don't nickel-and-dime with change orders. Third-party costs (hosting, software subscriptions, ad spend) are separate and clearly identified upfront. You'll never see surprise invoices for things you assumed were included.

Be direct with us about your timeline needs during our first call, and we'll tell you honestly what's realistic.
