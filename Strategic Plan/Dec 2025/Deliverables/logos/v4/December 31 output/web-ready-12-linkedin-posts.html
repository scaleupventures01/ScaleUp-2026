            <div class="post-content" id="post1">The most valuable thing I ever built was... nothing.

A client came to me ready to invest six figures in custom software. They had specs. They had a timeline. They had budget approval.

They wanted me to build it.

Instead, I spent two weeks asking uncomfortable questions:

"What problem are you actually solving?"
"Who specifically has this problem?"
"How do they solve it today?"
"What happens if you do nothing?"

What we discovered: An off-the-shelf solution could handle 80% of their needs for a fraction of the cost. The remaining 20% wasn't worth the custom development risk.

I talked myself out of a large contract.

Here's what I've learned:

The best consultants sometimes tell you NOT to build.

Most tech vendors have an incentive to say yes. More scope = more revenue. The harder question is asking whether you should build at all.

Before any technical decision, ask:
- Does this problem actually need software?
- Can existing tools solve it?
- What's the cost of waiting 6 months?
- Who loses if we don't build this?

Sometimes the answer is: Don't build. Not yet. Maybe never.

That's not failure. That's clarity.

            <div class="post-content" id="post2">Early-stage startups don't need more advice.

They need someone who's been in the room when things break.

I've sat across from founders who have brilliant ideas and zero clarity on what to build first. The gap between "great concept" and "working product" is where most startups die.

Here's what I've seen kill momentum:

1. Building everything at once
Trying to launch with every feature means launching with none.

2. Confusing activity with progress
Busy isn't the same as moving forward. Meetings aren't milestones.

3. Ignoring the boring stuff
The unsexy work (process, documentation, prioritization) is what makes the exciting stuff possible.

4. Hiring before you understand the work
You can't hire someone to do a job you haven't done yourself.

What actually helps early-stage founders:

Someone who asks hard questions before you write code.
Someone who's seen the patterns that work.
Someone who tells you what NOT to build.

The best startup advice isn't about growth hacks or fundraising tricks.

It's about focus. Ruthless, uncomfortable focus.

What's the one thing you're building right now?

It's building the wrong thing.

I worked on a proof of concept for a trading application. The technical team wanted to jump straight into building sophisticated features.

I pushed back with one question: "What's the minimum we need to prove this works?"

We stripped the scope down to the essential hypothesis. What does the user need to see to know this solves their problem?

The result: A focused POC that answered the core question without months of development.

Here's what I learned about proof of concepts:

A POC isn't a small version of your product.
It's an experiment designed to validate or kill an assumption.

The goal isn't to impress. It's to learn.

Questions every POC should answer:
- Does the core concept work?
- Will users actually use it?
- Is this technically feasible?
- What don't we know yet?

Most POCs fail because they try to do too much. They become mini-products instead of learning tools.

The best POCs are almost embarrassingly simple.

Because the goal isn't building. It's knowing what to build next.

            <div class="post-content" id="post4">Product management isn't about having all the answers.

It's about asking the questions everyone else avoids.

After years of PM consulting, here's what separates good product teams from great ones:

Great teams ask "why" before "how."

Most teams jump to solutions. They start with features and work backward to justify them.

Great teams start with problems. They obsess over understanding the pain before prescribing the cure.

What this looks like in practice:

Instead of: "We need to build a dashboard."
Ask: "What decision are we helping users make?"

Instead of: "Let's add notifications."
Ask: "What behavior are we trying to change?"

Instead of: "The competitor has this feature."
Ask: "Is this our users' problem too?"

The best PMs I've worked with spend 70% of their time on problem definition and 30% on solution design.

Most teams do the opposite. And wonder why they keep building features nobody uses.

Before your next sprint planning session, try this:

For every feature on the backlog, ask: "What happens if we don't build this?"

If you can't articulate the cost of inaction, you don't understand the problem yet.

            <div class="post-content" id="post5">The job offer you accept shapes the next decade of your life.

Most candidates make this decision with terrible information.

They compare base salary. Maybe benefits. They Google "average salary for [role]" and hope for the best.

That's not negotiation. That's guessing.

The real questions rarely get asked:

What's the equity actually worth?
How does the vesting schedule compare?
What's the promotion path look like?
Is the 401k match better than a higher base?

I've seen candidates leave significant money on the table because they didn't know how to evaluate the full picture.

Here's what I've learned about offer evaluation:

1. Total compensation is more than salary
Stock, bonuses, benefits, 401k matching - it all counts.

2. Compare like with like
A startup equity package and a public company RSU grant aren't the same thing.

3. Know your leverage
The best time to negotiate is after you have the offer, before you accept.

4. Time pressure is a tactic
"We need an answer by Friday" usually isn't true.

The companies that want you will wait for a thoughtful decision.

The ones that won't? That tells you something too.

            <div class="post-content" id="post6">Why I sometimes tell clients not to hire me.

It sounds backwards. But hear me out.

Not every problem needs a consultant. Not every project needs external help. Sometimes the best advice is: "You can handle this internally."

Here's how I evaluate whether I can actually help:

1. Do you have the capability but lack the capacity?
This is where consultants add value. I can bring expertise and bandwidth.

2. Do you have neither capability nor capacity?
This might work, but you'll need to build internal capability too. I won't be here forever.

3. Do you have both but lack clarity?
Sometimes you just need someone to ask the right questions. That might be a conversation, not an engagement.

4. Is this a people problem dressed as a process problem?
I can't fix your org chart. And pretending a new system will solve a leadership issue is a waste of everyone's time.

The consultants who build trust are the ones who say no when it's the right call.

I'd rather have a smaller book of business with clients where I actually make a difference.

Every engagement should leave the client more capable than before.

If you're just creating dependency, you're not consulting. You're extracting.

            <div class="post-content" id="post7">The most expensive decision in tech isn't what you build.

It's what you build that you shouldn't have.

I've watched teams spend months on custom solutions when off-the-shelf tools existed. The justification is always the same:

"We need something tailored to our workflow."
"Nothing out there does exactly what we need."
"We'll own it and can customize anything."

Here's what they don't calculate:

- The maintenance cost for the next 5 years
- The opportunity cost of developer time
- The risk of the original developers leaving
- The features you'll never build because you're maintaining this

The build vs. buy decision isn't about capability. It's about focus.

Every hour spent maintaining custom infrastructure is an hour not spent on your core product.

Questions to ask before building:

1. Is this our competitive advantage?
If no, buy it.

2. Does a good-enough solution exist?
If yes, use it. Perfect is the enemy of shipped.

3. Do we have capacity to maintain this forever?
If no, you're creating technical debt, not an asset.

4. What else could we build with this time?
That's the real cost.

The companies that win aren't the ones with the most custom code.

They're the ones who build only what they must.

            <div class="post-content" id="post8">Strategy isn't what you say yes to.

It's what you say no to.

Every startup I've worked with has more ideas than capacity. More features on the backlog than developers to build them. More opportunities than hours in the day.

The hard part isn't generating ideas. It's killing them.

Here's how I help teams prioritize:

The "If Not This, Then What?" Test

For every initiative you're considering, ask: What won't get done if we do this?

Make the tradeoff explicit. Put it in the room. Decide with full information.

The "Who Cares?" Test

Who specifically will be disappointed if we don't ship this? Name them. If you can't, maybe nobody actually needs it.

The "Still Care in 6 Months?" Test

Most urgency is manufactured. Very few things are actually urgent. The ones that still matter in 6 months are the ones worth doing now.

The "What Did We Learn?" Test

Look at the last 5 things you shipped. Which ones actually moved metrics? Double down on those patterns. Kill the ones that didn't.

Strategy isn't a document. It's a discipline.

The discipline to say "not now" to good ideas so you can say "yes" to great ones.

What's on your "not now" list?

            <div class="post-content" id="post9">The hardest conversation in startups isn't about money.

It's about timing.

"Are we ready to scale?"
"Should we raise now?"
"Is it time to hire that VP?"

Timing questions have no clear answer. But getting them wrong is expensive.

What I've learned from supporting early-stage companies:

Hiring too early is worse than hiring too late.

You can't grow your way out of chaos. If your processes are broken, more people make it worse, not better.

Raising too early limits your options.

The best time to raise is when you don't desperately need it. Desperation shows. Investors smell it.

Scaling too early kills companies.

Growth is expensive. If you scale before you've found product-market fit, you're just burning money faster.

The questions to ask before any "scale" decision:

1. What's repeatable about our current success?
If you can't articulate it, you can't scale it.

2. What breaks first when we grow 3x?
Know your bottlenecks before you hit them.

3. Are we running toward something or away from something?
Growth should be pulled by demand, not pushed by fear.

Patience is a competitive advantage in a world obsessed with speed.

            <div class="post-content" id="post10">A proof of concept that "works" isn't always a success.

Let me explain.

The goal of a POC isn't to prove you CAN build something. It's to learn whether you SHOULD.

I've seen teams celebrate POCs that technically work but proved nothing:

"Look, it runs!"
"The API integrates!"
"Users completed the flow!"

Great. But did you answer the real question?

The questions a good POC should answer:

1. Is the core hypothesis valid?
Not "can we build it" but "does this solve the problem?"

2. What did we learn that we didn't know before?
If the answer is "nothing," you didn't run a POC. You ran a demo.

3. What's still uncertain?
A good POC closes some questions and opens others. That's how learning works.

4. What would make us kill this project?
Know your exit criteria before you start. Otherwise you'll rationalize anything.

The best POC outcomes I've seen:

"We learned this approach won't work. Here's why. Here's what we'll try instead."

That's not a failure. That's exactly what a POC is for.

Clarity is the output. Not code.

            <div class="post-content" id="post11">The best consultants make themselves unnecessary.

This is the opposite of how most consulting works.

Traditional model: Create dependency. Make yourself indispensable. Bill forever.

Better model: Transfer knowledge. Build internal capability. Leave the client stronger.

How I think about every engagement:

1. What will the client be able to do after that they couldn't before?

If the answer is "nothing without me," I haven't done my job.

2. Am I building muscle or just doing reps?

There's a difference between handling something FOR a team and teaching them HOW to handle it.

3. What's my exit plan?

Every engagement should have a defined end. Not because I'm eager to leave, but because that's how you measure success.

4. Could they explain my approach to someone else?

If my process is a black box, I'm not consulting. I'm performing.

The consulting engagements I'm most proud of ended with: "Thanks, we've got it from here."

That's not a client leaving. That's a client graduating.

And graduates send referrals.

            <div class="post-content" id="post12">The decisions that matter most are the ones you can't undo.

I call them one-way doors.

Hiring your first employee: one-way door.
Raising venture capital: one-way door.
Choosing your tech stack at scale: one-way door.

Two-way doors? Those you can experiment with. Try it. If it doesn't work, walk back through.

Most people treat every decision like a one-way door. They agonize. They committee. They delay.

And most people treat actual one-way doors like two-way doors. They rush. They follow convention. They don't count the cost.

Here's my framework:

For two-way doors:
- Move fast
- Bias toward action
- Learn by doing
- Don't overthink

For one-way doors:
- Slow down
- Get outside perspective
- Stress-test assumptions
- Understand the irreversibility

The skill isn't decision-making. It's decision-typing.

Knowing which kind of door you're walking through changes everything.

What one-way door decision are you facing right now?
