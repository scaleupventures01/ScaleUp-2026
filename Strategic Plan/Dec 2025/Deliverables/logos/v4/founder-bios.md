## Calvin Williams Jr.
**Founder and Managing Partner**

Calvin Williams Jr. founded ScaleUp Ventures with a straightforward conviction: business owners deserve to see the numbers before they invest. His credibility comes from experience on both sides of the table. As Founder and CEO of Freeman Capital, Calvin raised approximately $4 million and successfully executed two exits - one private sale and one acquisition by private equity. He understands what it takes to build value, find the right buyers, and close deals that work for everyone involved.

That investment experience shapes how ScaleUp operates. Calvin has sat across the table from skeptical investors, defended projections under scrutiny, and delivered returns that matched his forecasts. When he tells a client their numbers need to work before they spend, it comes from someone who has had his own numbers examined by people writing seven-figure checks. His approach combines strategic business acumen with hands-on execution - he leads client engagements from discovery through delivery, personally ensuring that every recommendation is backed by data and every project is tied to measurable outcomes.

Calvin maintains a network of over 20,000 professionals across the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill region, built through a career focused on helping businesses navigate financial and operational challenges. His published work on business resilience during economic uncertainty has guided business owners through market volatility - advice grounded in real-world application, not theory. What sets Calvin apart is his patience. He would rather walk away from a deal than take on a client who is not the right fit. ScaleUp operates from a position of selectivity, not desperation - for business owners who have been burned before, that discipline matters.

## Ray Addison II
**Partner, Growth Strategy and Operations**

Ray Addison II brings over fifteen years of marketing, operations, and sales leadership to ScaleUp Ventures. His credentials speak for themselves: a 2011 Marketing Achievement Award from Daimler Trucks North America for his work on the NASCAR Motorsports Program, which contributed to $2.2 billion in record sales revenue. That is not a theoretical case study - it is documented, measurable impact at scale.

Ray holds certifications in AI strategy, blockchain technology, digital marketing (George Washington University), and negotiation. He is a graduate of Leadership Charlotte Class 42 and served on the Board of Directors for Sustain Charlotte, demonstrating his commitment to building businesses that last. As a member of the American Marketing Association since 2014, he stays current on marketing best practices while remaining skeptical of industry fads that do not translate to real business results. He is bilingual in English and Spanish, expanding ScaleUp's ability to serve diverse business communities.

What makes Ray valuable is his ability to translate marketing strategy into sales results. He understands that business owners do not want impressions or engagement metrics - they want customers. His approach is direct: identify what works, measure it, and do more of it. For ScaleUp's clients, Ray ensures that every growth initiative is accountable to bottom-line outcomes.

## Aaron Mitchell
**Partner, Technology and Development**

Aaron Mitchell leads ScaleUp Ventures' technology and development practice with a builder's mindset. His background spans software engineering, product development, and systems architecture - the technical expertise required to transform business strategy into working solutions. Aaron approaches every project with the same question: how do we deliver measurable value, not just functional code?

His development philosophy aligns with ScaleUp's proof-first methodology. Before writing a single line of code, Aaron ensures the project scope is tied to specific business outcomes. This discipline protects clients from the all-too-common scenario of paying for technology that looks impressive but fails to move the needle. His GitHub portfolio demonstrates consistent contribution to meaningful projects, and his engineering background includes experience building systems designed for scale and reliability.

Aaron's value to clients extends beyond technical execution. He bridges the gap between what business owners need and what technology can deliver - translating complex technical decisions into plain language so clients understand exactly what they are investing in and why. For business owners who have been frustrated by developers who cannot explain their own work, Aaron provides clarity and accountability at every stage.

## About the Founders: A Shared Philosophy

The three partners of ScaleUp Ventures share a common belief: business owners have been oversold and underserved for too long.

Between them, they bring decades of experience in marketing, technology, investment, and business strategy. More importantly, they bring a track record of measurable results - from $4 million raised and two successful exits to billion-dollar sales achievements to software systems that scale. They have each witnessed firsthand what happens when consultants make promises they cannot keep, and they built ScaleUp to be the antidote.

Their approach is simple: prove it before you buy. Every engagement begins with a custom ROI model built on the client's actual numbers - not industry benchmarks or hopeful projections. If the math does not work, they will tell you. If a project is not the right fit, they will walk away. This selectivity is not arrogance; it is respect for the client's investment and the firm's reputation.

For business owners aged 50 and older who built successful companies through hard work and sound judgment, ScaleUp Ventures offers something rare: a partner that operates the same way they do. Watchful before acting. Measured in approach. Decisive when the evidence is clear.
