## Part 1: Active Voice Preference

### The Core Principle

ScaleUp Ventures uses **active voice by default**. Active voice puts the actor first, makes claims direct, and communicates confidence. Passive voice obscures responsibility, sounds bureaucratic, and triggers skepticism in our target audience.

Our skeptical 30-55 year old business owners have heard too many consultants hide behind passive language:
- "Results were achieved..." (By whom?)
- "Value was delivered..." (Who says?)
- "Your business will be transformed..." (By magic?)

Active voice demands accountability. It says: **We did this. We stand behind it.**

### When Active Voice Applies

- All website copy
- All email communications
- All proposals and presentations
- All social media content
- All internal documents
- All client reports

### The One Exception

Technical documentation or legal disclosures may use passive voice when the actor is genuinely unknown, irrelevant, or when convention requires it. Example: "The data is encrypted using AES-256" (the system does it, not a person).

---

### 10 Before/After Examples: Passive to Active

**Example 1: Service Description**
| Before (Passive) | After (Active) |
|------------------|----------------|
| "A comprehensive analysis is conducted before any recommendations are made." | "We analyze your business completely before we recommend anything." |

**Why it works:** "We analyze" claims ownership. "We recommend" takes responsibility. The client knows exactly who does what.

---

**Example 2: Value Proposition**
| Before (Passive) | After (Active) |
|------------------|----------------|
| "ROI is demonstrated through a proof-of-concept phase that is offered to all prospective clients." | "We demonstrate your ROI through a proof-of-concept. Every client sees the numbers first." |

**Why it works:** Removes the bureaucratic distance. Makes the offer feel personal and direct.

---

**Example 3: Client Results**
| Before (Passive) | After (Active) |
|------------------|----------------|
| "A 47% increase in conversion rate was achieved within the first 90 days." | "We increased their conversion rate by 47% in 90 days." |

**Why it works:** Claims credit clearly. The skeptical reader knows who delivered the result.

---

**Example 4: Process Explanation**
| Before (Passive) | After (Active) |
|------------------|----------------|
| "Data is gathered from multiple sources and analyzed using proprietary methods." | "We gather data from multiple sources and analyze it with our proprietary methods." |

**Why it works:** Reveals the actor. Shows human expertise, not mysterious processes.

---

**Example 5: Objection Handling**
| Before (Passive) | After (Active) |
|------------------|----------------|
| "It is understood that trust must be earned over time." | "We understand you need proof before you trust us. That's why we prove it first." |

**Why it works:** Acknowledges the objection directly. Uses "we" to show empathy and "you" to address the client.

---

**Example 6: Methodology**
| Before (Passive) | After (Active) |
|------------------|----------------|
| "Each business is assessed across 47 distinct metrics to ensure accuracy." | "We assess your business across 47 distinct metrics to ensure accuracy." |

**Why it works:** "We assess your business" is personal. "Each business is assessed" is impersonal and cold.

---

**Example 7: Call to Action**
| Before (Passive) | After (Active) |
|------------------|----------------|
| "A consultation can be scheduled at your convenience." | "Schedule your consultation. We'll show you the proof." |

**Why it works:** Commands action. Reinforces the core value proposition in the same breath.

---

**Example 8: About Us**
| Before (Passive) | After (Active) |
|------------------|----------------|
| "ScaleUp Ventures was founded on the principle that business owners deserve proof before investment." | "We founded ScaleUp Ventures on one principle: you deserve proof before you invest." |

**Why it works:** "We founded" is a founder speaking. "Was founded" sounds like a Wikipedia entry.

---

**Example 9: Testimonial Framing**
| Before (Passive) | After (Active) |
|------------------|----------------|
| "Significant improvements were noted across all key performance indicators." | "They saw significant improvements across all key performance indicators." |

**Why it works:** "They saw" puts the client as the actor in their own success story. Even better: use the actual client's words.

---

**Example 10: Competitive Positioning**
| Before (Passive) | After (Active) |
|------------------|----------------|
| "Unlike other firms, commitments are only requested after proof has been delivered." | "Unlike other firms, we only ask for your commitment after we deliver proof." |

**Why it works:** "We ask" and "we deliver" show accountability. The competitor comparison becomes a clear claim of superiority.

---

## Part 2: Pronoun Usage Rules

### Overview

Pronoun choice shapes relationship dynamics. Using the wrong pronoun at the wrong moment creates distance, sounds impersonal, or comes across as evasive. These rules ensure consistency.

### The Three Pronouns and When to Use Each

---

### "WE" - First Person Plural

**Definition:** Refers to ScaleUp Ventures as a collective entity.

**When to Use:**
- Describing ScaleUp's actions, services, or commitments
- Making promises or claims on behalf of the company
- Expressing company philosophy or values
- Taking responsibility for outcomes

**Examples:**
- "We prove it before you buy."
- "We analyzed 47 data points before making this recommendation."
- "We believe skepticism is healthy. That's why we built our entire model around proof."
- "We made a mistake in our initial assessment. Here's what we learned."

**The Psychology:** "We" creates intimacy without being presumptuous. It's a team talking to you, not a faceless corporation or a lone wolf.

**Channel-Specific Notes:**
| Channel | "We" Usage |
|---------|------------|
| Website | Primary pronoun for all service descriptions |
| Email | Use for company communications, proposals, updates |
| Proposals | Use when describing ScaleUp's deliverables and commitments |
| Social | Use sparingly; avoid sounding corporate |

---

### "YOU" - Second Person

**Definition:** Refers directly to the reader, prospect, or client.

**When to Use:**
- Describing benefits the client receives
- Addressing pain points or challenges the client faces
- Making the reader the hero of their own story
- Direct calls to action

**Examples:**
- "You deserve to see the ROI before you invest."
- "You want to see proof before committing."
- "Your business is unique. Your proof-of-concept should be too."
- "You decide when the timing is right."

**The Psychology:** "You" makes the message personal. It says: we're talking to YOU, not some abstract "businesses" or "clients." Skeptical business owners respond to direct address because it feels honest, not like a broadcast.

**Channel-Specific Notes:**
| Channel | "You" Usage |
|---------|------------|
| Website | Primary pronoun for benefit statements and calls to action |
| Email | Use for personalized communications; avoid in mass marketing |
| Proposals | Use when describing outcomes and benefits |
| Social | Use to engage directly; creates connection |

---

### "THEY/THEM" - Third Person

**Definition:** Refers to clients, competitors, or external parties.

**When to Use:**
- Case studies and testimonials (referring to past clients)
- Competitor references (without naming)
- Industry commentary
- When the third party is the subject of the story

**Examples:**
- "They saw a 47% increase in conversion within 90 days."
- "Most consultants promise results. They rarely prove them first."
- "Their business had been stuck at the same revenue for three years."
- "Other firms ask for your commitment upfront. They hope you won't ask for proof."

**The Psychology:** "They" creates useful distance. When discussing competitors, it avoids sounding petty by not naming names. When discussing client successes, it respects confidentiality while still telling the story.

**Channel-Specific Notes:**
| Channel | "They" Usage |
|---------|------------|
| Website | Case studies, competitive positioning |
| Email | Client success stories, industry observations |
| Proposals | Competitor comparisons, past client references |
| Social | Industry commentary, thought leadership |

---

### Pronoun Combinations That Work

The most effective ScaleUp copy often combines pronouns in a single thought:

| Combination | Example | Effect |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| We + You | "We prove it. You decide." | Partnership with client agency |
| You + They | "You've seen what they promise. You know how that ends." | Shared skepticism toward competitors |
| We + They + You | "We've helped them succeed. Now it's your turn." | Social proof + direct invitation |

---

### Pronouns to Avoid

**"I" - First Person Singular**
- Avoid in all branded communications
- Exception: Personal messages from a specific founder with their name attached
- Why: "I" sounds like a one-person operation; undermines the "trusted advisory firm" positioning

**"One" - Impersonal Pronoun**
- Never use. Sounds pretentious and academic.
- Bad: "One might consider the implications..."
- Good: "You should consider the implications..."

**"It" as Subject (Weak "It")**
- Avoid "It is..." constructions (known as expletive "it")
- Bad: "It is important to understand that..."
- Good: "You need to understand that..."

---

## Part 3: Sentence Structure Guidance

### Average Sentence Length

Target: **12-18 words** for body copy.

Shorter sentences (5-10 words) for emphasis and impact.

Never exceed 25 words in a single sentence.

### Sentence Types by Purpose

**Statement (Declarative):** The default. Makes claims, delivers information.
- "We prove it before you buy."
- "Our process takes 30 days."

**Question (Interrogative):** Opens dialogue, acknowledges skepticism.
- "Need to see proof before you commit?"
- "What if you could see the ROI first?"

**Command (Imperative):** Drives action.
- "Schedule your consultation."
- "See the proof yourself."

**Fragment (Intentional):** Creates rhythm and emphasis.
- "No pressure. No commitment. Just proof."
- "Patience. Then precision."

### Sentence Structures That Work

**Short + Short + Short (Rhythm)**
"We watch. We analyze. Then we act."

**Long + Short (Punch)**
"After analyzing 47 data points across your business operations, sales processes, and customer feedback, we identified the three changes that will move the needle. Here's the proof."

**Question + Answer (Dialogue)**
"Skeptical? Good. So are we. That's why we test everything."

**Statement + Fragment (Emphasis)**
"We don't make promises. We make proof."

### Sentence Structures to Avoid

**Run-on Sentences**
- Bad: "We analyze your business and then we create a custom strategy and implement it while tracking results and making adjustments as needed."
- Good: "We analyze your business. We create a custom strategy. We implement it, track results, and adjust as needed."

**Weak Openings**
- Avoid starting with: "There is...", "It is...", "This is..."
- Bad: "There are many reasons why businesses fail to scale."
- Good: "Businesses fail to scale for three reasons."

**Buried Lead**
- Don't hide the main point in subordinate clauses.
- Bad: "Although many consulting firms claim to offer proof-of-concept services, very few actually demonstrate ROI before asking for payment."
- Good: "Most consulting firms never prove ROI before asking for payment. We do."

## Part 4: Tone Calibration by Channel

### The Three Voice Attributes (Always Present)

Every piece of ScaleUp content reflects these three attributes, though the balance shifts by channel:

| Attribute | Definition | Heron Connection |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| **Watchful** | Observant, analytical, sees what others miss | The heron stands motionless, watching |
| **Measured** | Patient, deliberate, unhurried, precise | The heron waits 30 minutes before striking |
| **Decisive** | Clear, confident, unequivocal when evidence supports action | The heron never misses when it strikes |

---

### Channel: Website

**Tone Balance:** 40% Watchful, 30% Measured, 30% Decisive

**Character:** Confident authority that respects the visitor's intelligence and skepticism. Not trying too hard. Not overselling. Letting the proof speak.

**Pronoun Emphasis:** "You" for benefits, "We" for actions

**Sentence Length:** Mix of short punchy headlines and medium-length body copy (12-18 words)

**Examples:**

Homepage Headline:
- ON-BRAND: "Proof First."
- OFF-BRAND: "The Premier Business Advisory Firm Transforming Your Future!"

Service Page:
- ON-BRAND: "We build your proof-of-concept before you invest. You see the numbers. Then you decide."

---

### Channel: Email

**Tone Balance:** 30% Watchful, 40% Measured, 30% Decisive

**Character:** Personal, respectful of time, substantive. Never spammy or urgent. Feels like a note from a trusted advisor, not a marketing blast.

**Pronoun Emphasis:** "You" dominant, "We" secondary

**Sentence Length:** Shorter than website copy. 10-15 words average. Scannable.

**Examples:**

Subject Line:
- ON-BRAND: "Your proof-of-concept is ready"
- OFF-BRAND: "Don't miss this opportunity to transform your business!"

Opening:
- ON-BRAND: "I noticed something in your latest data. Worth a 10-minute conversation."

Call to Action:
- ON-BRAND: "Let me know if Thursday at 2pm works."

---

### Channel: Proposal

**Tone Balance:** 25% Watchful, 35% Measured, 40% Decisive

**Character:** Authoritative, thorough, evidence-heavy. The tone of a trusted expert laying out a clear path forward. Decisive once the evidence is presented.

**Pronoun Emphasis:** "We" for commitments, "You" for outcomes

**Sentence Length:** Can be longer (15-22 words) for complex explanations. Use headers and bullets for scannability.

**Examples:**

Executive Summary:
- ON-BRAND: "Based on our 30-day analysis of your operations, we identified three high-impact opportunities. This proposal details our recommendations, the expected ROI for each, and the proof-of-concept we've already built."

- OFF-BRAND: "We recommend implementing a comprehensive marketing optimization strategy leveraging best-in-class tools and methodologies..."

- OFF-BRAND: "For a limited time, we're offering a special introductory rate..."

---

### Channel: Social Media

**Tone Balance:** 45% Watchful, 25% Measured, 30% Decisive

**Character:** Observational, thoughtful, occasionally provocative. The trusted industry observer sharing insights. Never self-promotional, never salesy.

**Pronoun Emphasis:** Minimal "We" - focus on "You" and industry observations ("They")

**Sentence Length:** Very short. 8-15 words. Punchy. Works in feeds.

**Examples:**

LinkedIn Post:
- ON-BRAND: "Most consultants ask for payment before proving anything. Imagine if every industry worked that way."
- OFF-BRAND: "We're thrilled to announce our latest success story! Contact us to learn how ScaleUp Ventures can help YOUR business..."

Thought Leadership:
- ON-BRAND: "The pattern is always the same: companies buy the promise, not the proof. Three years later, same problems, different consultant."

Engagement:
- ON-BRAND: "Interesting perspective. What did the data tell you?"
- OFF-BRAND: "Great post! Thanks for sharing! Check out our website for more insights!"

---

### Channel: Client Reports

**Tone Balance:** 20% Watchful, 40% Measured, 40% Decisive

**Character:** Precise, evidence-heavy, actionable. The trusted advisor delivering clear findings and unequivocal recommendations. No hedging when the data is clear.

**Pronoun Emphasis:** "We" for findings and recommendations, "You" for next steps

**Sentence Length:** Variable. Short for findings, medium for context, short again for recommendations.

**Examples:**

Finding:
- ON-BRAND: "Customer acquisition cost increased 34% over the past quarter. Primary driver: paid search CPCs up 47% with no corresponding improvement in conversion rate."
- OFF-BRAND: "It has been noted that there has been an increase in customer acquisition costs which may be attributed to various factors..."

Recommendation:
- ON-BRAND: "Reduce paid search spend by 25%. Reallocate to email nurture campaigns. Expected result: CAC reduction of 18% within 60 days. We've already tested this with a sample audience. Here are the results."
- OFF-BRAND: "We recommend considering a strategic reallocation of marketing resources which could potentially yield improved results..."

Executive Summary:
- ON-BRAND: "Three changes will move the needle. One you can implement this week. We've documented the expected ROI for each. Details on pages 4-12."

## Appendix: The Heron Test

Before publishing any content, ask:

1. **Would a heron say this?** (Patient, watchful, precise - or rushed and noisy?)
2. **Is this proven or promised?** (Does it make claims we can back up?)
3. **Would a skeptical 45-year-old trust this?** (Or would they roll their eyes?)
4. **Is the actor clear?** (Active voice - who is doing what?)
5. **Is the reader addressed directly?** (Do we speak TO them, not AT them?)

If the answer to any question is no, revise before publishing.
