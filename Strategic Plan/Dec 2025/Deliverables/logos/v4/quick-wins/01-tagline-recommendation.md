## Final Recommendation

### Primary Tagline

**"Certainty First."**

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Word Count | 2 words (optimal) |
| Memorability | 5/5 - Ultra-short, sticky, repeatable |
| Clarity | 4/5 - Clearly positions brand as proof-focused |
| Differentiation | 5/5 - No competitor uses this framing |
| Audience Alignment | 5/5 - Speaks to core desire of skeptical owners |
| **Total Score** | **19/20** |

### Why "Certainty First." Over "Proof First."

Both taglines are excellent. Here is the strategic rationale for leading with "Certainty First.":

| Factor | "Certainty First." | "Proof First." |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Emotional resonance | Speaks to what they WANT (certainty) | Describes what we DO (prove) |
| Audience psychology | Skeptical owners crave certainty | Proof is the mechanism, not the outcome |
| Competitor framing | No one offers certainty | "Proof" appears in data/analytics contexts |
| Heron alignment | Patience yields certainty | Patience enables proof |
| Brand positioning | Premium, confident, outcome-focused | Process-focused, technical |

**The key insight:** Our target audience does not wake up wanting "proof" - they wake up wanting certainty. They are data-driven decision makers who need to see the ROI before committing resources. What they want is certainty that their next investment will pay off - backed by real numbers, not promises.

"Certainty First." promises the outcome. "Proof First." describes the process. Leading with outcomes is more compelling.

### Backup Tagline

**"Proof First."** (18/20 score)

This tagline remains excellent and should be used in contexts where the mechanism matters more than the outcome - particularly in proposals, case studies, and when explaining methodology.

## Tagline Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Use "Certainty First." as a complete sentence with period
- Pair with concrete, proof-focused supporting copy
- Connect to the Heron symbol narrative when context allows
- Use in places where the target audience (30-55, skeptical) will see it
- Maintain consistent capitalization: "Certainty First."

### Don't

- Do not alter the wording: not "Certainty Comes First" or "First, Certainty"
- Do not use without the period - the period creates confidence
- Do not pair with hyperbolic claims that undermine the message
- Do not use in technical/internal documentation where it has no audience value
- Do not translate without brand team approval (nuance matters)

## Transition from Current Tagline

**Current:** "We Prove It Before You Buy"
**New:** "Certainty First."

### Transition Strategy

| Asset | Timeline | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Logo lockup | Immediate | Update primary brand files |

| Proposals | Week 2 | Template update |

### Handling the Old Tagline

"We Prove It Before You Buy" remains valid supporting copy. It explains the mechanism behind "Certainty First." Use it:
- In explanatory contexts where the short tagline needs unpacking
- In longer-form content (blog posts, case studies)
- When transitioning prospects who need more detail

**Example transition:**
> "Certainty First. That means we prove it before you buy - using your real numbers."
