# ScaleUp Ventures Proof Vocabulary Palette

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Created:** December 31, 2025
**Purpose:** Evidence-based word lists calibrated for skeptical business owners who need certainty before commitment

---

## Strategic Context

### The Vocabulary Challenge

ScaleUp Ventures serves **growth-focused business owners aged 30-55** who need to see proof before committing. These owners are:

- **Skeptical by nature** - they're data-driven and want to see the ROI first
- **Trust-driven** - 80% value trust over cost in purchasing decisions
- **Evidence-oriented** - 97% say case studies are the most reliable form of proof
- **Jargon-averse** - Only 4% trust tech sales representatives

### The Heron Principle

Like the heron that watches patiently before striking with precision, ScaleUp's vocabulary embodies:

1. **Observation** - Words that show careful analysis before action
2. **Patience** - Words that demonstrate thoroughness, not rushing
3. **Precision** - Words that communicate exactness and accuracy
4. **Strike** - Words that convey decisive action at the right moment

### Core Promise Connection

> "We prove it before you buy."

Every word in this palette should reinforce pre-engagement ROI modeling - the differentiator that fewer than 5% of agencies offer.
