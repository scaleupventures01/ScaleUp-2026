## PROMPT 1: Conservative Seal (seal-1.png)

```
CRITICAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Professional logo design, vector-style rendering
- Clean white or transparent background
- NO gradients, NO glows, NO shadows, NO 3D effects
- Flat design with precise geometric forms
- Color palette ONLY: Navy #0F1729, Gold #D4A853, Muted Gold #B8956E, Cream #FAF8F5
- Must look like it was designed by a senior brand designer at Pentagram or Wolff Olins
- NOT clip art, NOT stock imagery, NOT generic business icons
- The aesthetic of a $50,000 brand identity project, not a $50 Fiverr logo
- Think: The precision of Swiss design meets the warmth of a trusted advisor

Create a distinctive VERIFICATION MARK logo — not a generic trust badge, but something with the weight and authority of a notary's embossed seal or an engineer's certification stamp.

VISUAL CONCEPT:
Three concentric circular elements with deliberate, measured spacing:
1. OUTER RING: A substantial circular border (not a thin hairline — this has WEIGHT)
2. MIDDLE: An open negative space ring creating rhythm and breathing room
3. CENTER: Three small circles arranged in precise triangular formation — these are "proof points" representing data points that converge to verify a thesis

The three inner circles should feel like measurement markers on a precision instrument, or survey coordinates marking verified positions.

GEOMETRY:
- Outer ring stroke weight: substantial, authoritative (think 8-12% of total diameter)
- The three center dots form a perfect equilateral triangle
- Dots should be solid circles, substantial enough to read at small sizes
- Total composition fits within a perfect square

COLOR EXECUTION:
- Outer ring and structural elements: Navy (#0F1729)
- Three proof points in center: Gold (#D4A853)
- Background: White

MOOD & FEELING:
The seriousness of a professional certification. The weight of an accounting firm's seal. Something you'd find embossed on bond certificates or stamped on approved engineering blueprints. Authority without coldness. Verification without bureaucracy.

WHAT THIS IS NOT:
- Not a generic "trust badge" from an e-commerce checkout
- Not a shield or crest
- Not a laurel wreath
- Not a basic checkmark
- Not governmental or bureaucratic feeling

RENDER AS:
Professional emblem-style logo, flat vector design. Should look like it could be pressed into sealing wax or embossed on premium stationery.

## PROMPT 2: Creative Triangle Seal (seal-2.png)

```
CRITICAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Professional logo design, vector-style rendering
- Clean white or transparent background
- NO gradients, NO glows, NO shadows, NO 3D effects
- Flat design with precise geometric forms
- Color palette ONLY: Navy #0F1729, Gold #D4A853, Muted Gold #B8956E, Cream #FAF8F5
- Must look like it was designed by a senior brand designer at Pentagram or Wolff Olins
- NOT clip art, NOT stock imagery, NOT generic business icons
- The aesthetic of a $50,000 brand identity project, not a $50 Fiverr logo
- Think: The precision of Swiss design meets the warmth of a trusted advisor

Create a geometric verification mark where a TRIANGLE IS IMPLIED by three substantial circular points at each vertex, connected by thin precise lines. Make this MORE DISTINCTIVE and MEMORABLE than a typical seal.

VISUAL CONCEPT:
Three solid circles positioned at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. These circles are connected by thin, precise lines forming the triangle's edges. The entire composition is surrounded by a single substantial circular ring — like a seal border. Add subtle sophistication: perhaps the outer ring has a double-line treatment, or the connecting lines have elegant breaks or notches that suggest precision engineering.

GEOMETRY:
- Three vertex circles: substantial enough to anchor the design (like survey markers or navigational waypoints)
- Connecting lines: thin and precise, clearly secondary to the points, could have decorative interruptions suggesting measurement calibration marks
- Outer circular ring: substantial border weight with potential double-line or inset treatment for added distinction
- The overall impression: precision instrument, surveyor's mark, certified measurement, but with more visual interest

COLOR EXECUTION:
- Three vertex points: Gold (#D4A853)
- Connecting lines: Navy (#0F1729), thin
- Outer ring: Navy (#0F1729), substantial weight
- Background: White

MOOD:
The precision of land surveying meets the craft of fine watchmaking. The verification of measured coordinates. Three independent data points that together prove a position. Mathematical certainty rendered as sophisticated visual design. This should feel like something on a vintage compass or astronomical instrument.

RENDER AS:
Distinctive geometric logo mark, flat vector style. Clean, precise, authoritative, but with enough visual interest to be memorable. The aesthetic of certified blueprints meets precision instruments.

## PROMPT 3: Maximum Creativity Emblem (seal-3.png)

```
CRITICAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Professional logo design, vector-style rendering
- Clean white or transparent background
- NO gradients, NO glows, NO shadows, NO 3D effects
- Flat design with precise geometric forms
- Color palette ONLY: Navy #0F1729, Gold #D4A853, Muted Gold #B8956E, Cream #FAF8F5
- Must look like it was designed by a senior brand designer at Pentagram or Wolff Olins
- NOT clip art, NOT stock imagery, NOT generic business icons
- The aesthetic of a $50,000 brand identity project, not a $50 Fiverr logo
- Think: The precision of Swiss design meets the warmth of a trusted advisor

Create a SEAL-STYLE emblem logo that is EXTRAORDINARY and MEMORABLE while remaining completely professional. This should be the kind of mark that makes people stop and look twice — not because it's flashy, but because it's exceptionally well-crafted and distinctive.

VISUAL CONCEPT:
A substantial circular border contains curved text:
- "SCALEUP" arcs along the TOP interior of the circle
- "VENTURES" arcs along the BOTTOM interior of the circle
- In the CENTER: a sophisticated arrangement of three proof points, but elevated — perhaps arranged within a secondary geometric element like a subtle inner triangle, or positioned as if they're coordinates on an implied grid or star formation
- Consider adding subtle architectural details: fine inner border lines, small calibration marks around the perimeter like a compass or clock face, or elegant negative space divisions
- Typography follows the curve naturally, like text on a wax seal

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Use a refined serif typeface style (like Crimson Pro or similar)
- Text is ALL CAPS, tracked out for readability on the curve
- The text feels integrated, not slapped on — it's part of the seal
- Consider subtle weight variations or decorative terminals on key letters

GEOMETRY:
- Outer ring: substantial weight with potential for secondary decorative elements (inner border, perimeter marks)
- Text sized to fill the interior curve comfortably with breathing room
- Center element: the three gold proof points, but arranged with more sophistication — perhaps on an implied grid, within a secondary triangle, or positioned as if marking cardinal directions on a compass
- Small decorative elements can add interest without cluttering: think vintage engineering diagrams or astronomical charts

COLOR EXECUTION:
- Outer ring and text: Navy (#0F1729)
- Three center proof points: Gold (#D4A853)
- Any secondary decorative elements: subtle Navy or Muted Gold (#B8956E)
- Background: White

MOOD:
Like something that could be pressed into hot wax to seal treaties. A professional certification mark with the gravitas of a centuries-old institution. The weight of verification meets the elegance of fine craftsmanship. Classic, timeless, trustworthy — but with enough distinctive character to be instantly recognizable. This should feel like the logo of an organization that has verified deals worth billions.

RENDER AS:
Sophisticated emblem-style logo, flat vector design. Should look equally at home on a business card and embossed on a leather portfolio. The kind of mark that makes designers say "I wish I'd designed that."
