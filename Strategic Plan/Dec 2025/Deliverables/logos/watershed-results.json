Color palette ONLY: Navy #0F1729, Gold #D4A853. Premium brand identity design. NOT clip art, NOT stock imagery.\n\nCreate a minimalist geometric logo representing a WATERSHED - an angular mountain peak or ridge viewed head-on. The peak is a clean angular apex in Gold #D4A853, with two descending ridgelines in Navy #0F1729 flowing down from the summit. Simple, architectural, like a continental divide. Two or three flow lines emanate downward from each side of the peak, suggesting water or energy flowing in opposite directions. Clean white background. The mark should feel structural and permanent, suitable for a serious business consultancy.",

Design shows an abstract angular peak or apex where everything changes direction. The apex/peak rendered in Gold #D4A853 represents the decisive moment. Two bold angular forms in Navy #0F1729 converge at this golden peak, then continue outward in transformed directions. Use negative space creatively. The composition suggests both a mountain summit and a moment of transformation. Should feel like a mark carved in stone - permanent, institutional, commanding respect. White background.",

Gold #D4A853 marks the pivotal moment at the peak. Navy #0F1729 geometric forms show the before-and-after states of transformation. The design should be memorable and distinctive - like the best corporate marks. Push creative boundaries while maintaining professional elegance.
