  "evaluation": {
    "substanceTest": "All three logos would be taken seriously by a 58-year-old business owner. They convey precision, expertise, and substance without being flashy or trendy.",
    "precisionTest": "Every angle and proportion feels intentional. The geometric forms are clean and purposeful.",
    "clicheTest": "Successfully avoids generic business imagery - no arrows, handshakes, globes, or swooshes.",
    "scaleTest": "All marks should be recognizable at small sizes due to simple geometric forms.",
    "trustTest": "The designs feel like a firm that proves results through precision and expertise.",
    "timelessnessTest": "These designs will look appropriate in 10+ years - they rely on fundamental geometric principles rather than trends."
  },
  "recommendation": "Fulcrum-3 (Intersection Point) offers the most distinctive and memorable mark while still maintaining professional gravitas. It best captures the brand concept of 'leverage' through the visual metaphor of two forces meeting at a transformative point. However, Fulcrum-1 may be preferred for more conservative applications."
