This represents the fulcrum - the precise pivot point where leverage transforms small force into significant movement. The apex point where the triangle touches its base is highlighted in gold, representing the critical moment of leverage.\n\nGEOMETRY:\n- One clean inverted triangle (equilateral or slightly isoceles for elegance)\n- The triangle points DOWNWARD, balanced on its apex\n- Apex point rendered in bright gold as the focal point\n- Clean, sharp corners - absolutely no rounded edges\n- Proportions: width approximately 1.5x the height\n- A subtle horizontal baseline may anchor the composition\n\nCOLOR EXECUTION:\n- Main triangle body: Navy (#0F1729)\n- Apex point/tip: Bright Gold (#D4A853) - this is the leverage point, the fulcrum\n- The gold accent should be visible but refined - not overpowering\n- Background: Pure white\n\nMOOD:\nPrecision engineering. The moment before movement. Potential energy. Something an engineer or physicist would appreciate. Not flashy - MATHEMATICAL.\n\nWHAT THIS IS NOT:\n- Not a play button\n- Not a generic arrow or chevron\n- Not decorative - every angle means something\n\nRENDER AS:\nProfessional geometric logo, flat vector style, suitable for business cards and corporate materials. Clean, balanced, iconic."

The extreme elongation creates tension and drama. The sharp gold tip at the bottom represents concentrated force and precision leverage.\n\nGEOMETRY:\n- Elongated inverted triangle, much taller than it is wide\n- Height to width ratio approximately 3:1 or 4:1 - notably stretched\n- The wedge tapers to a sharp gold point at the bottom\n- Upper edge is a clean horizontal line\n- Sides angle dramatically inward to the apex\n- The gold tip extends slightly beyond just the point - perhaps the bottom 15-20% of the wedge\n\nCOLOR EXECUTION:\n- Upper portion of wedge: Navy (#0F1729)\n- Lower tip/point section: Bright Gold (#D4A853) - creating a distinctive two-tone effect\n- The transition between navy and gold should be a clean horizontal line, no gradient\n- Optional: thin gold line at the base where the point touches the implied ground\n- Background: Pure white\n\nMOOD:\nDynamic tension. A blade poised to move. The moment of maximum potential before action. Sophisticated yet bold. Something a design-forward CEO would immediately respect.\n\nWHAT THIS ACHIEVES:\n- More distinctive silhouette than a standard triangle\n- The elongation creates drama and memorability\n- The gold tip stands out as the critical leverage point\n- Feels premium and intentional\n\nRENDER AS:\nProfessional geometric logo, flat vector style. Bold yet refined. A wedge of possibility."

Where they intersect, a small gold diamond marks the fulcrum - the pivot point where leverage happens. This is NOT a simple X - it's two distinct forms that share one critical point of contact.\n\nGEOMETRY:\n- Two elongated triangular or trapezoidal planes\n- They intersect at ONE specific point, not overlapping entirely\n- Think: Two paper airplanes touching nose-to-nose, OR two angular brackets crossing\n- OR two chevron shapes that share a single vertex\n- At the exact intersection point: a small gold diamond shape (not a circle)\n- The overall composition should be balanced but asymmetric in an interesting way\n- One plane could be slightly larger/longer than the other\n\nPOSSIBLE INTERPRETATIONS:\n- Two V shapes that touch at their points, forming an hourglass-like figure with a gold center\n- Two elongated chevrons crossing in the middle, gold diamond at the cross point\n- An angular X-like form where the crossing point is clearly the focal element\n- Two triangular sails meeting at their tips\n\nCOLOR EXECUTION:\n- Plane 1: Navy (#0F1729)\n- Plane 2: Muted Gold (#B8956E) - creating visual depth and distinction\n- Intersection diamond: Bright Gold (#D4A853) - the most luminous element\n- Background: Pure white\n\nMOOD:\nArchitectural precision meets artistic vision. The intersection of forces. Sophisticated complexity that resolves into clarity. Something that makes a 60-year-old business owner say \"That's different - but I understand exactly what it means.\"\n\nWHAT THIS MUST ACHIEVE:\n- Instantly memorable and ownable silhouette\n- Clear focal point at the gold intersection\n- Feels premium and intentional, not random\n- Professional enough for a law firm, creative enough for a design studio\n- The gold diamond is clearly the \"leverage point\" - the fulcrum moment\n\nRENDER AS:\nExtraordinary geometric logo, flat vector style. Where precision meets poetry. An intersection of intent."
