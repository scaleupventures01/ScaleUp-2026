*Compiled: December 31, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This document synthesizes research on the psychology of logo design, including how shapes, colors, and compositions influence perception. Key findings focus on geometric forms that convey trust, optimal colors for B2B professional services, and how business owners aged 30-55 perceive logos differently than younger audiences.

---

## 1. The Science of Logo Perception

### How the Brain Processes Logos

Shapes are among the first things our brains process when we see a logo. Before we even read the name or process colors, we determine whether the design feels strong or soft, stable or dynamic, trustworthy or playful - all based on geometry.

**The Bouba-Kiki Effect**
One of the most compelling demonstrations of shape psychology was discovered by psychologist Wolfgang Kohler in 1929. When shown two shapes - one with soft, rounded edges and another with sharp, angular points - and asked which is "bouba" and which is "kiki," **95-98% of people across all cultures assign the same answers**. This demonstrates the universal, cross-cultural nature of shape perception.

### Gestalt Theory in Logo Design

The gestalt theory, conceptualized by German psychologists Kurt Koffka, Max Wertheimer, and Wolfgang Kohler, states that "the sum is greater than the individual parts." Key principles include:
- **Proximity** - Elements close together are perceived as related
- **Similarity** - Similar elements are grouped together
- **Continuity** - The eye follows smooth paths
- **Figure-ground** - Objects are distinguished from backgrounds
- **Symmetry** - Balanced elements create order

---

## 2. Geometric Shapes and Trust

### Circles and Ovals - Community and Connection

**Psychological Associations:**
- Unity, togetherness, and wholeness
- Friendship, love, and community
- Protection and lasting connections
- No beginning or end - symbols of continuity

**Trust Factor:** Circles build trust through feelings of inclusivity and connection. The surrounding circle evokes unity and a sense of completeness.

**Best For:** Social media brands, tech companies focused on connection, lifestyle brands, community-focused organizations

---

### Squares and Rectangles - Stability and Reliability

**Psychological Associations:**
- Structure and trustworthiness
- Security, solidity, and dependability
- Logic, professionalism, and control
- Authority and reliability

**Trust Factor:** The firm, right-angled edges are perceived as secure and dependable. People strongly associate squares and rectangles with buildings, reinforcing feelings of trust and authority.

**Best For:**
- Finance and banking
- Legal services
- Healthcare
- Journalism
- Conservative or high-trust industries

**Research Finding:** "Angular geometric shapes represent structure and trustworthiness. With their firm, right-angled edges, they're perceived as secure, solid, and dependable."

---

### Triangles - Power and Progress

**Psychological Associations:**
- Hierarchy and energy
- Power, strength, and dynamism
- Progressive change and innovation
- Aspiration (when pointing upward)
- Stability (when pointing downward)

**Trust Factor:** Triangles convey competence and forward movement, but their sharpness can come across as aggressive if overused.

**Directional Considerations:**
- **Upward-pointing:** Aspirational and energetic
- **Downward-pointing:** More stable, but can suggest decline
- **Equilateral:** Balanced
- **Right triangles:** Dynamic

**Best For:** Startups, tech companies, innovative brands seeking a cutting-edge appearance

---

### Shape Recommendations Summary

| Brand Type | Recommended Shapes |
|------------|-------------------|
| Innovative/Disruptive | Triangles, diagonal lines, abstract shapes |
| Trustworthy/Established | Squares, rectangles, symmetrical designs |
| Warm/Community-focused | Circles, curves, organic forms |

---

## 3. Color Psychology for B2B Professional Services

**Why Blue Works:**
- Embodies trust, reliability, and professionalism

## 8. Industry-Specific Considerations
