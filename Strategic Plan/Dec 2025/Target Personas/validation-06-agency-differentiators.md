# Validation Study: Is "ROI-Focused" Actually Differentiated?

## Executive Summary

**Finding: "ROI-focused" and "results-driven" are among the MOST overused agency claims and provide ZERO differentiation.**

The research definitively answers the validation question: claiming to be "ROI-focused" is not a differentiator. It's a cliche that agencies should avoid. However, there IS a significant gap between agencies that CLAIM ROI focus versus those that PROVIDE actual ROI models and attribution systems. This gap represents a genuine differentiation opportunity.

## The Top 10 Most Overused Agency Differentiator Claims

Based on analysis from Econsultancy's "34 Violently Cliched Phrases" study, Hinge Research's "12 Worst Differentiators," and agency positioning expert Ben Potter's work:

| Rank | Claim | Why It Fails | Prevalence |
|------|-------|--------------|------------|
| **1** | Results-focused / ROI-obsessed | Every agency claims this; it's the baseline expectation, not a differentiator | Ubiquitous - literally every agency |
| **2** | Data-driven | Data is "plentiful and often free" - not unique | 77%+ of agencies now claim AI/data capabilities |
| **3** | Full-service / One-stop-shop | Breadth undermines competitive advantage; specialists command premiums | ~40,000 US agencies, most claim this |
| **4** | Award-winning | So overused that agencies now stand out by NOT using it | Standard claim |
| **5** | Passionate | "No one buys from an agency because they are passionate" - Ben Potter | Standard claim |
| **6** | Great people / Best team | Impossible to prove without tangible credentials | Standard claim - "everyone feels like they have a great team" |
| **7** | Innovative / Cutting-edge | "One of the most overused words in business today" - Hinge | Standard claim |
| **8** | Trusted partner | "Thousands of firms have embraced these words since 2001" - Hinge | Thousands of firms |
| **9** | Transparent / Honest | Implies competitors are dishonest; unverifiable before engagement | Standard claim |
| **10** | Bespoke / Tailored / Customized | All work is customized by nature - basic business practice | Standard claim |

## The "ROI-Focused" Claim: Detailed Analysis

### What the Research Says

**Ben Potter (Agency Positioning Expert):**
> "Results-focused" is explicitly listed among phrases that are "overused, obvious or irrelevant." Agency land is "plagued with jargon" including 'results-focused' alongside 'data-driven', 'passionate', and 'innovative'.

**Econsultancy's 34 Cliches Study:**
- **#30: "Results-focused"** - "Expected baseline, not differentiator; questioned why agencies exist otherwise"
- **#31: "ROI obsessed"** - Variant of results-focused "claiming intensity without distinction"
- **#32: "Measurable"** - Another results variant "presented as unique positioning"

**Hinge Research (Professional Services):**
> "Great client service" and "quality work" are among the WORST differentiators because "every buyer assumes you do quality work" and "everyone does it, or claims to."

### The Prevalence Problem

| Statistic | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| ~40,000 marketing/advertising agencies in the US | Statista via Workamajig |
| 75% of B2B advertising fails to drive growth because it's "too fearful to stand out" | LinkedIn B2B Institute |
| Only 5.75% of B2B buyers could correctly identify brands in blind tests | LinkedIn B2B Institute "Sea of Sameness" |
| "Most agency websites are a sea of sameness" | Digiday analysis |

## The Critical Gap: CLAIMING ROI vs PROVIDING ROI Models

### The Claim (What Agencies Say)

- Virtually every agency claims to be "ROI-focused" or "results-driven"
- These claims appear in positioning statements, not operational capabilities
- Claims are supported by vanity metrics (impressions, clicks, engagement)

### The Reality (What Agencies Actually Do)

| Measurement Challenge | Statistic | Source |
|-----------------------|-----------|--------|
| Marketers who struggle to prove ROI | 81% of B2B marketers | HubSpot |
| Proving ROI is a top challenge | 40% say it's their #1 challenge | Gartner 2025 Survey |
| Companies that actually track ROI | Only 46.7% | Marketful |
| Companies that measure subscriber lifetime value | Only 27.7% | Marketful |
| Agencies using multi-touch attribution | 75% claim to, but execution varies | Ruler Analytics |
| Marketers who attribute manually with spreadsheets | 42% | Ruler Analytics |
| Marketers failing to attribute revenue to inbound calls | 62% | Ruler Analytics |
| B2B orgs that measure content ROI | Only 35% of the 91% who invest in it | Content Marketing Institute |

### The Differentiation Opportunity

**The gap is enormous:**
- CLAIMING "ROI-focused" = No differentiation (everyone does it)
- PROVIDING actual ROI attribution models = Rare capability

**Key insight from Camphouse:**
> "Proving ROI to clients is still one of the biggest challenges agencies face in 2025. While digital marketing gives you more data than ever, turning that data into something clients can understand and act on takes real work."

## What Actually Differentiates Agencies

### Effective Differentiators (Research-Backed)

| Differentiator | Why It Works | Evidence |
|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **Industry Specialization** | "Clients want specialists, not indistinguishable cookie-cutter generalists" | High-growth firms 3x more likely to have strong specialization (Hinge) |
| **Visible Experts** | Named individuals with demonstrable expertise | 37.3% of referral-driving factors (Hinge) |
| **Specific Business Challenge Focus** | Solving one problem exceptionally well | Fastest-growing firms use niche strategies (Hinge) |
| **Unique Technology/Process** | Must be ACTUALLY unique and provable | Only works if genuinely differentiated |
| **Client Size Focus** | Serving specific company sizes exclusively | Creates operational fit |
| **Performance-Based Pricing** | Fees tied to measurable results | Only 38% of marketers get pricing model options they want (SoDA) |

### Hinge Research Statistics on Differentiation

- High-growth firms are **3x more likely** to have a strong differentiator
- Specialized agencies that narrow focus are **2x more likely to achieve fast growth** (26%+ fee income increase) and high profitability (61%+ gross profit)
- Visible expertise drives **37.3%** of all referral-driving factors

## The 12 Worst Differentiators (Hinge Research)

These claims HURT more than help:

1. **Best People** - Unsubstantiated without credentials
2. **Great Client Service** - Cannot be evaluated before purchase
3. **Full Service** - Undermines specialist positioning
4. **Best Value** - Positions in low-margin commodities
5. **Proprietary Process** - "Most are variations on a theme, if not identical"
6. **Putting Clients First** - Expected baseline
7. **Committed to Excellence** - Lacks resonance
8. **Innovation** - "One of the most overused words in business"
9. **Passion** - Abstract, unprovable
10. **Trusted Advisors** - Cliched since 2001
11. **Quality** - Entry-level expectation
12. **Your Partner** - Trust earned over time, not claimed

## Implications for Market Positioning

### The Validation Answer

**Is "ROI-focused" differentiated?**

**NO.** It is one of the most overused claims in the agency industry. Every agency says it. It provides zero competitive advantage.

### However...

**Is there a gap between claiming ROI focus and delivering ROI measurement capabilities?**

**YES.** A massive gap exists:

| What Agencies SAY | What Agencies DO |
|-------------------|------------------|
| "We're ROI-obsessed" | 81% struggle to prove ROI |
| "Results-driven approach" | Only 46.7% track ROI |
| "Data-driven decisions" | 42% attribute manually via spreadsheets |
| "We measure what matters" | 62% fail to attribute call revenue |

### The Differentiation Opportunity

The differentiation is NOT in claiming ROI focus. The differentiation is in:

1. **Actually providing ROI models** that clients can use
2. **Building attribution systems** that connect marketing to revenue
3. **Demonstrating proven ROI** with case studies and actual numbers
4. **Performance-based pricing** that puts skin in the game

This shifts the positioning from:
- "We're ROI-focused" (claim everyone makes)
- To: "We build ROI models your CFO will actually use" (capability few deliver)

## Conclusion

**"ROI-focused" is definitively NOT a differentiator.** It's a baseline expectation that every agency claims but few actually deliver.

The opportunity lies not in the claim, but in the capability: providing actual ROI attribution models, measurement frameworks, and CFO-ready business cases that most agencies cannot deliver despite their claims.

This validates that positioning around "providing ROI models" (a capability) rather than "being ROI-focused" (a claim) could represent genuine differentiation - if backed by actual tools and frameworks that agencies currently lack.
