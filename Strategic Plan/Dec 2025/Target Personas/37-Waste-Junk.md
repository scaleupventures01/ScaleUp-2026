## Technology Adoption & Pain Points

### Current State of Technology

**Manual Operations Prevalence**:

- Spreadsheets for tracking (often outdated)
- Phone-based booking and dispatch
- No real-time visibility into operations

**Documented Pain Points** (ranked by severity):

|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Manual scheduling causing double-bookings | 9 | Lost revenue, damaged reputation |

### Technology Quotes from Industry

> "Companies using paper schedules, text threads, or whiteboards often experience jobs slipping through the cracks, double-booked crews, or customers calling to ask about their pickup status."

> "Problems with previous software that worked well for junk removal but poorly for dumpsters, including losing dumpsters, billing issues, no weight entries or rental overage tracking, and inability to pin drop dumpster locations."

> "When working with paper, important documents can get lost or misplaced, making it difficult for teams to access information."

### Digital Presence Gap

- Many small operators have no website or outdated websites
- Local SEO is critical but underutilized
- Most customers search "dumpster rental near me" before calling
- "If your business isn't easily found when a potential customer searches... you're simply not in the running"
- Online reviews essential but often unmanaged
