# Target Persona Research: Small/Mid-Size Manufacturing Industry

**Research Date**: December 30, 2025
**Researcher**: ScaleUp Ventures Strategic Analysis
**Objective**: Evaluate SMB manufacturing as a target market for dev, growth marketing, and AI/automation services

---

## Executive Summary

Small/mid-size manufacturing represents a **HIGH-OPPORTUNITY** target market for ScaleUp Ventures. The industry combines aging ownership demographics, documented technology lag, significant modernization pain, and available budgets. The 548,000+ small manufacturing businesses in the U.S. face existential pressure to digitize but lack internal capabilities to do so.

**Key Finding**: 65% of manufacturers self-identify as "digital transformation laggards" with no firm plans to modernize, creating a massive addressable market for done-for-you services.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|

## Conclusion

**Recommendation: PURSUE**

Small/mid-size manufacturing represents an exceptional target market for ScaleUp Ventures:

1. **Large addressable market** (548K+ businesses)
2. **Ideal demographics** (older owners who cannot DIY)
3. **Documented technology gap** (65% are laggards)
4. **Existential pain** (compete or die, sell or close)
5. **Limited competition** (only 8 specialized agencies)
6. **Perfect service fit** (dev + marketing + AI = complete solution)

The primary challenges are sales cycle length and acquisition effort, but these are manageable with proper go-to-market strategy. The succession/exit angle provides a powerful urgency lever that most competitors do not leverage.

**Next Steps**:
1. Develop manufacturing-specific case studies
2. Create digital maturity assessment tool
3. Identify NAM/trade association partnership opportunities
4. Build manufacturing landing page and content
5. Compile target list of $5M-$50M manufacturers in priority geographies
