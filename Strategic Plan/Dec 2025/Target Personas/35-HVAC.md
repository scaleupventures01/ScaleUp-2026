**Purpose**: Evaluate HVAC Contractors as target persona for dev, growth marketing, and AI/automation services

## Executive Summary

**Verdict**: EXCELLENT CANDIDATE - High Priority Pursuit

The HVAC Contractors industry represents an outstanding opportunity for ScaleUp Ventures. This is a $156B industry with 117,000 businesses, predominantly owned by older operators (average age 54-55) who struggle with technology adoption. The industry faces severe digital maturity gaps, with 80% of businesses struggling to generate enough leads and most still relying on outdated marketing methods. The combination of older ownership, strong budget capacity, intense pain points, and clear acquisition channels makes this one of the strongest persona fits for ScaleUp's services.
