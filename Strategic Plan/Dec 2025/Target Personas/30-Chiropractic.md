- 72% of struggling practitioners report patients mentioning financial stress
- 88% of struggling practices say they need new patients ASAP
- Common thread: minimal investment in digital marketing

- Inactive patients don't return after initial visit
- "Churn and burn" trap - cycling through new patients without building relationships
- Many practices losing lifetime value by focusing only on acquisition

**6. Documentation & Compliance (Severity: 6/10)**

- Most agencies use templated solutions; ScaleUp can offer custom development
- Few competitors address the "technology laggard" positioning specifically

## Sales Cycle Considerations

### Decision-Making Structure

- **Group practices (27-30%)**: May require partner consensus
- **Franchise locations**: Corporate approval may be needed

- Longer for group practices or larger investments
- Trust-building is critical given conservative profession

### Common Objections

2. "Too expensive" - Focus on ROI and cost of inaction
3. "I don't have time to manage this" - Emphasize done-for-you approach
4. "My nephew does my website" - Show professional vs. amateur results
5. "My patients come from referrals" - Data on patient search behavior

### Buying Triggers
- Practice revenue decline
- Increased competition from new practices or franchises
- Approaching retirement and wanting to maximize practice value
- Poor online reviews affecting reputation
- Staff turnover increasing administrative burden
