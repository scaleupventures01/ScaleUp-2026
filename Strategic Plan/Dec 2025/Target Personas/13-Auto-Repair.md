# Target Persona Analysis: Auto Repair / Mechanic Shops

**Date**: December 30, 2025
**Analyst**: ScaleUp Ventures Research
**Industry**: Automotive Repair & Maintenance (NAICS 8111)

---

## Executive Summary

The auto repair industry represents a **strong opportunity** for ScaleUp Ventures. With 165,000-299,000 establishments generating $183-199 billion annually, this is a massive, fragmented market dominated by technology-laggard independent owners. The industry faces existential disruption fears (EVs), severe labor shortages, and modernization pressures -- yet most owners lack the skills or time to adapt. Marketing agencies exist but are specialized in lead generation, not comprehensive digital transformation. The gap for dev + growth + AI services is significant.
