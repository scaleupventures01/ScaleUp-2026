# Validation Research: ROI Guarantees and Pre-Engagement ROI Models

**Research Date**: December 31, 2025
**Question to Validate**: Is "We build a model showing how you make your money back BEFORE you spend a dollar" genuinely differentiated?

---

## Executive Summary

**VERDICT: PARTIALLY DIFFERENTIATED - with important nuances**

| Aspect | Rarity Level | Differentiation Potential |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Money-back ROI guarantees | RARE (~5-10% of agencies) | HIGH - but risky to claim |
| Pre-engagement ROI projections | MODERATELY COMMON | LOW-MEDIUM - expected by sophisticated buyers |
| Custom financial impact models | RARE (<20% of firms) | HIGH - when done rigorously |
| Value-based pricing tied to outcomes | VERY RARE (17.3% of consultants) | HIGH |
| Written ROI guarantees with skin in the game | EXTREMELY RARE (<2% estimate) | VERY HIGH |

**Key Finding**: The combination of (1) pre-engagement custom ROI modeling + (2) financial skin in the game is genuinely rare. However, generic ROI projections are increasingly expected. The differentiation lies in the *specificity* and *accountability* of the model, not just having one.

## Part 2: How Common is Pre-Engagement ROI Modeling?

### Evidence of Prevalence

**Industry Standard for Sophisticated Buyers:**
> "Both clients and consultants want to see the effect on the bottom line – before they sign on the dotted line."
> - [Chief Executive](https://chiefexecutive.net/roi-based-consulting-contracts-pros-cons/)

**Recommended Best Practice:**
> "Ask the consultant for an ROI projection before starting the project and at the halfway point."
> - [Chief Executive](https://chiefexecutive.net/roi-based-consulting-contracts-pros-cons/)

**Agency Proposal Standards:**
> "Agency proposals should include ROI calculations, payback period, and growth projections. This positions your service as an investment, not a cost."
> - [Ellty](https://www.ellty.com/blog/agency-proposal-examples)

### However: Most Skip Rigorous Pre-Work

**Key Statistic:**
> "More than 90 percent of small agencies lack specialized talent for market research and attribution modeling."
> - [CEOWORLD Magazine](https://ceoworld.biz/2025/04/28/marketings-biggest-lie-the-ugly-truth-about-why-agencies-dont-guarantee-results/)

**The Capability Gap:**
> "Most firms cannot predict outcomes because they skip rigorous market research and attribution modeling—essentially 'flying blind' without data-driven tools."
> - [CEOWORLD Magazine](https://ceoworld.biz/2025/04/28/marketings-biggest-lie-the-ugly-truth-about-why-agencies-dont-guarantee-results/)

### Distinction: Projection vs. Custom Model

| Type | Prevalence | Value |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Generic "Expected ROI: 5:1" claims | VERY COMMON | LOW - no credibility |
| Calculator-based projections (plug in your numbers) | COMMON | LOW-MEDIUM |
| Custom financial model using client data | RARE | HIGH |
| Model with accountability tied to it | VERY RARE | VERY HIGH |

## Part 3: Value-Based Pricing Adoption Statistics

**Critical Data Point:**
> "Only 17.3% of consultants leverage value-based pricing as their pricing strategy."
> - [Consulting Success](https://www.consultingsuccess.com/value-based-pricing)

**Why It Remains Low:**
> "Most consulting companies do not use value-based pricing when pricing their services... Established clients feel more comfortable allocating budgets for consulting as compared to distributing percentages at scale."
> - [Mario Peshev](https://mariopeshev.com/answers/consulting-dont-prefer-value-based-pricing/)

**Industry Trajectory:**
> "McKinsey's pricing shift reflects a broader disruption across professional services. Leaders at EY have expressed similar expectations, predicting that AI may push consulting toward a 'service-as-software' model where clients pay for outcomes rather than hours."
> - [Hunt Scanlon](https://huntscanlon.com/mckinsey-continues-to-deliver-value-it-just-charges-differently-for-it-now/)

## Part 4: Why Agencies Avoid ROI Guarantees

### Primary Reasons Cited

**1. Uncontrollable Variables**
> "There are too many uncontrollable variables to make promises like that to any business."
> - [Cyrusson](https://cyrusson.com/if-a-marketing-agency-guarantees-roi-avoid-them-at-all-costs/)

**2. Economic Factors**
> "Economic variables such as inflation, interest rates, and employment levels influence purchasing power. Marketing companies cannot control these external factors."
> - [Cross Productions](https://crossproductions.co.uk/why-marketing-agencies-dont-guarantee-sales-results/)

**3. Platform Algorithms**
> "The platform algorithm has a lot to do with what users see, when and how they see it... agencies have no impact on that."
> - [Up There Everywhere](https://www.upthereeverywhere.com/blog/why-your-digital-agency-cannot-guarantee-results-and-should-not-do-it)

**4. Business Model Misalignment**
> "The traditional marketing agency model is obsolete. Agencies don't want to be held financially accountable for poor performance."
> - [CEOWORLD Magazine](https://ceoworld.biz/2025/04/28/marketings-biggest-lie-the-ugly-truth-about-why-agencies-dont-guarantee-results/)

### Industry Warnings Against Guarantees

> "If a Marketing Agency Is Guaranteeing ROI, Run the Other Way"
> - [Entrepreneur Magazine](https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/if-a-marketing-agency-is-guaranteeing-roi-run-the-other-way/283422)

> "You must stay away from an agency that promises a 'marketing guarantee' as this is one of the biggest lies."
> - [Cyrusson](https://cyrusson.com/if-a-marketing-agency-guarantees-roi-avoid-them-at-all-costs/)

## Part 5: West Monroe Model - "Best in Class" Example

West Monroe represents the gold standard for pre-engagement financial modeling:

### Their Approach

**Pre-Engagement Commitment:**
> "With every client story they publish, they publish the measurable results. With each new qualifying proposal they send out the door, they expect their people to include and commit to the expected financial ROI."
> - [West Monroe](https://www.westmonroe.com/perspectives/point-of-view/consulting-roi)

**Business Case Rigor:**
> "Attaching numbers to words through a financial model is essential to determine whether the investment will be worth it. For example, if entering a new market could be worth $47 million, then spending $2 million with consultants to do that would make sense."
> - [West Monroe](https://www.westmonroe.com/perspectives/point-of-view/consulting-roi)

**Results:**
- Rated 12 percentage points higher than industry average for value vs. fees
- 97% of clients consider them a strategic advisor
- Net Promoter Score of 80 in 2024

## Part 6: Differentiation Analysis

### What's NOT Differentiated

1. **Claiming "We focus on ROI"** - Everyone says this
2. **Generic ROI projections** - Expected by sophisticated buyers
3. **Case studies showing past ROI** - Standard practice
4. **ROI calculators on website** - Many agencies offer these (One Day Agency, AgencyAnalytics, etc.)

### What IS Differentiated

1. **Custom financial model using CLIENT's actual data** - Rare
2. **Written, contractual ROI commitment** - Very rare
3. **Automatic credits/refunds if targets missed** - Extremely rare
4. **Fees tied to outcomes (value-based)** - Only 17.3% of consultants
5. **Quarterly accountability with defined KPIs** - Rare

### The Differentiation Spectrum

```
COMMON -----------------------------------------> RARE

"We track ROI"                                   "We guarantee ROI in writing"
     |                                                |
     v                                                v
Generic claims        Calculator       Custom model    Financial skin
about results         on website       with data       in the game

(Everyone)           (Many)            (Few)           (Very few)

## Part 8: Verdict and Recommendations

### Is "We build a model showing how you make your money back BEFORE you spend a dollar" differentiated?

**PARTIALLY YES, WITH CAVEATS:**

#### Differentiated IF:
- The model is CUSTOM using client's actual data (not a calculator)
- There's a WRITTEN commitment tied to the model
- You have FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY (credits, refunds, fees at risk)
- You define SPECIFIC, MEASURABLE KPIs (not vague metrics)
- You show HOW you'll achieve it (methodology, not just numbers)

#### NOT Differentiated IF:
- It's a generic calculator anyone can use
- There's no accountability tied to the projection
- The "model" is just estimated assumptions
- You don't have the analytical capability to build real models

### Positioning Recommendations

**Strong Positioning (if capabilities support it):**
> "We build a custom financial model using YOUR data before you sign anything. If our projections are wrong, we have skin in the game - [specific accountability mechanism]."

**Key Differentiators to Emphasize:**
1. **Custom, not template** - Uses client's actual numbers
2. **Pre-engagement, not post-hoc** - Before they spend a dollar
3. **Accountability, not just projection** - Financial consequences for being wrong
4. **Methodology, not magic** - Show how you'll achieve it

**What Sets You Apart from the ~10 Agencies Doing This:**
- Most guarantees are marketing-focused (leads, traffic, social)
- Very few do this for AI/automation projects
- Almost none combine pre-engagement modeling with ongoing accountability
- The B2B professional services space (vs. marketing) is less saturated with guarantee models

### Risk Considerations

**Legitimate Concern:**
> "Every reputable marketer understands the perils of guaranteed ROIs and rather focuses on the process."

**Mitigation:**
1. Be selective about which engagements get the guarantee (RedRover qualifies clients)
2. Define clear scope of what's guaranteed (specific KPIs, not overall business success)
3. Include client-side requirements (data access, implementation, decision authority)
4. Use credit/adjustment model rather than full refunds (less risk, still shows confidence)

## Bottom Line

**The positioning CAN be differentiated, but only if:**

1. You actually BUILD the custom model (not just say you will)
2. You have ANALYTICAL CAPABILITY most don't (>90% lack this)
3. You put REAL SKIN in the game (not just marketing language)
4. You're SELECTIVE about which clients get this offer

**The claim is rare enough (<10% of market) to be credible differentiation, but common enough in language that you need PROOF and SPECIFICITY to stand out.**

Recommended positioning emphasis: **The accountability mechanism and client-specific rigor, not just "we do ROI modeling."**
