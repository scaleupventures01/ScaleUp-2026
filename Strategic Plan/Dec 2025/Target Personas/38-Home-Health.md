# Home Health Agencies / Home Care Providers - Target Persona Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Industry**: Home Health Agencies / Home Care Providers (NAICS 621610, 624120)
**Analysis Date**: December 30, 2025
**Recommendation**: **STRONG FIT** - High-priority target for ScaleUp Ventures

Home health agencies represent an exceptionally strong target persona for ScaleUp Ventures. This $100+ billion industry is highly fragmented (nearly 500,000 providers, no company holds >5% market share), technology-laggard, and dominated by older owners facing a "Silver Tsunami" of retirement. The industry has severe pain points around staffing, scheduling, billing, and marketing that align perfectly with ScaleUp's dev, growth marketing, and AI/automation services.
