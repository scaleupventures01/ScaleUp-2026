This research validates how SMB owners select, evaluate, and reject agencies/consultants. The findings directly inform ScaleUp's positioning, sales approach, and trust-building strategies.

**Key Insight**: SMBs prioritize **value for money** and **proven ROI** above all else, but 40% churn within 2 years due to unmet expectations, poor communication, and lack of perceived value.

---

## 1. Top Selection Criteria SMBs Use When Choosing an Agency

### Primary Decision Factors (Ranked by Importance)

| Rank | Criterion | Evidence Strength |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Value for Money** | "Value for money dominated responses when SMBs were asked about key considerations" |
| 2 | **Proven Track Record/Case Studies** | 89% of marketers say testimonials/case studies are most effective for influencing purchases |
| 3 | **Industry Expertise** | Vertical-specific providers achieve 15% higher SMB retention after 2 years |
| 4 | **Clear ROI Measurement** | Agencies unable to display clear ROI immediately are at high churn risk |
| 5 | **Communication Quality** | "Bad communication will instantly make all other issues worse" |
| 6 | **Transparency** | 64% of consumers willing to pay more for companies they trust |
| 7 | **Flexibility/Customization** | Cookie-cutter solutions are a top complaint and red flag |

### What Builds Trust and Confidence

**The Four Factors of Trust** (Deloitte Research):
1. **Humanity** - Demonstrating care for the client's success
2. **Capability** - Proven expertise and competence
3. **Transparency** - Clear pricing, processes, and reporting
4. **Reliability** - Consistency in delivery and communication

**Trust Statistics**:
- 81% of customers more likely to return to a company they trust
- Up to 40% of perceived value comes from non-price factors (quality, service, trust)
- 68% of Americans have high trust in small businesses (Gallup)
- Small businesses are trusted because "they feel more like people to us"

### Social Proof Requirements

| Type | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Customer reviews | 92% read reviews when researching; 90% say reviews impact decisions |
| Testimonials | 88% trust as much as word-of-mouth from friends/family |
| Case studies | 9 out of 10 customers won't trust what you say - they want peer proof |
| Referrals | Most effective when asked immediately after positive testimonial |

**What Makes Case Studies Effective**:
- Feature similar businesses to the prospect (relatability)
- Include specific data, numbers, and analysis
- Show the problem-solution-result journey
- Integrate actual client testimonials within the case study

## 2. How Important is Proven ROI vs Other Factors?

### ROI is Critical - But Context Matters

**ROI Benchmarks SMBs Expect**:
- **Minimum acceptable**: 3:1 ratio (spend $1, get $3 back)
- **Good ROI**: 5:1 ratio (industry rule of thumb)
- **Exceptional ROI**: 10:1 ratio
- **Not profitable**: Below 2:1 ratio

**The ROI Paradox**:
- "Lack of perceived value" is the #1 reason SMBs churn from agencies
- 56% of churning SMBs leave within 6-12 months
- **Agencies don't have a lot of time to prove value**
- ROI must be demonstrated quickly, or clients leave

### ROI vs. Other Factors - The Balance

| Factor | Relative Weight | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **Proven ROI** | Very High | Must be measurable and demonstrated early |
| **Trust/Relationship** | High | 64% will pay more for trusted partners |
| **Communication** | High | Poor communication amplifies all other issues |
| **Price** | Medium | SMBs are price-sensitive but value matters more |
| **Expertise** | Medium-High | Industry knowledge increases retention by 15% |
| **Flexibility** | Medium | Customization over cookie-cutter approaches |

### Key Metrics SMBs Want Tracked

1. **Conversion rates**
2. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
3. **Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS)**
4. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**
5. **Revenue generated** (not just engagement metrics)

**Red Flag**: Agencies focusing only on vanity metrics (CTR, impressions) without connecting to business outcomes

## 3. What Causes SMBs to Reject Agency Proposals?

### Top Proposal Rejection Reasons

| Reason | Frequency | Prevention |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Doesn't address specific needs** | Very Common | Research the client's business thoroughly |
| **Unclear value proposition/ROI** | Very Common | State benefits AND how they'll be measured |
| **Pricing exceeds budget** | Common | Understand budget constraints early |
| **Lack of client research** | Common | Demonstrate knowledge of their market/industry |
| **Poor proposal quality** | Common | Professional formatting, no errors |
| **Generic/cookie-cutter approach** | Common | Customize every proposal |
| **No relevant case studies** | Moderate | Include similar client examples |
| **Bad timing** | Moderate | Qualify readiness before proposing |

### Proposal Quality Issues That Get Immediate Rejection

- Missing page numbers, inconsistent margins
- Tables without headings, charts without labels
- Technical terms without definitions
- Spelling and grammar errors
- Not following RFP guidelines

### The "No Doesn't Mean No" Insight

According to Marketing Wizdom research:
- **80% of prospects decline a proposal 4 times before saying "yes"**
- Most "nos" actually mean:
  - "No, convince me"
  - "No, I need more time"
  - "No, I need more information"

### Qualification Failures

Proposals also fail when the prospect was never qualified:
- Wrong decision-maker in the conversation
- No real budget authority
- "Tire kicking" without serious intent
- Timing not right for the business

## 4. Red Flags That Make SMBs Walk Away

### Critical Red Flags (Immediate Deal-Breakers)

| Red Flag | Why It's Fatal |
|----------|----------------|
| **Insisting on owning your website/domain** | Digital assets held hostage if relationship ends |
| **Owns your ad accounts** | Loss of access to years of data if you leave |
| **Guarantees fast/unrealistic results** | "Quick guaranteed results usually rely on shady tactics" |
| **Vague/hidden pricing** | "Avoid companies that quote fixed monthly cost without getting specific" |
| **Suspiciously low pricing** | "<$1000/month without discount means they're providing no real value" |

### Serious Red Flags (Major Concerns)

| Red Flag | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| **Doesn't ask about your ideal customer** | Can't create effective messaging without this |

| **Restrictive long-term contracts** | "May not be as diligent about impressing you with results" |
| **Only focuses on vanity metrics** | Disconnected from actual business outcomes |
| **Generic, cookie-cutter solutions** | Not customizing approach to your needs |

### Communication Red Flags

| Sign | What It Signals |
|------|-----------------|
| Slow response times | Low priority on your business |
| Delays exceeding 48 hours | Lack of customer care |
| Withholding data/insights | Trust and transparency issues |
| Reluctance to explain their work | Hiding incompetence or poor results |
| No regular updates | About to be blindsided by problems |

### 10 Frustrations Local Business Owners Have with Agencies

1. **Impersonal strategies** - Cookie-cutter approaches without understanding the business
2. **Lack of care** - Slow response, poor listening, resistance to feedback
3. **Lack of transparency** - Over-promise, under-deliver, withhold account access

5. **Expensive fees** - High costs without demonstrating sales/lead results
6. **Inflexible** - Slow to adapt to trends and technology changes
7. **Lack of industry knowledge** - Generic services, no sector expertise
8. **No pricing transparency** - Premium prices with junior staff, hidden costs
9. **Lack of customer service** - Unresponsive, delays >48 hours
10. **No control** - Over-reliance on agency pace, no client autonomy

## 7. Pricing Expectations

### SMB Marketing Budget Benchmarks

| Business Size | Monthly Budget Range | Notes |
|---------------|---------------------|-------|
| Early SMB (<$500K revenue) | $500-$2,500/month | Often DIY + selective outsourcing |
| Growth SMB ($500K-$2M) | $2,500-$7,500/month | Core services, 1-2 channels |
| Established SMB ($2M-$5M) | $5,000-$12,000/month | Multi-channel, more comprehensive |
| Larger SMB ($5M+) | $10,000-$25,000+/month | Full-service or multiple specialists |

### Revenue-Based Guidelines

- **SBA recommendation**: 7-10% of revenue for marketing
- **Post-COVID average**: 13.8% of overall business spending
- **Growth-focused**: 9-10% of new revenue target

### Service-Specific Pricing

| Service | Typical Range |
|---------|---------------|
| SEO | $500-$7,500/month |

## 8. Implications for ScaleUp Positioning

### What SMBs Want (That ScaleUp Can Deliver)

| SMB Need | ScaleUp Advantage |
|----------|-------------------|
| Proven ROI | AI-powered analytics with measurable outcomes |
| Industry expertise | Vertical-specific knowledge and positioning |
| Transparency | Clear pricing, accessible data, honest reporting |
| Flexibility | Customized strategies, not cookie-cutter |
| Fast results | AI acceleration without sacrificing quality |
| Communication | Regular updates, responsive support |
| Control | Client owns all assets and accounts |

### Trust-Building Priorities

1. **Lead with case studies** - Similar clients, specific results, real numbers
2. **Be transparent about pricing** - No hidden fees, clear value breakdown
3. **Demonstrate industry knowledge** - Speak their language, know their challenges
4. **Set realistic expectations** - Under-promise, over-deliver
5. **Communicate proactively** - Weekly updates, fast response times
6. **Give them control** - They own everything, can leave anytime

### Red Flags to Avoid (Competitive Differentiation)

ScaleUp should explicitly position against these agency behaviors:
- "We don't lock you into long contracts"
- "You own all your accounts and assets"
- "We track business outcomes, not vanity metrics"
- "We specialize in [vertical], not everything"
- "No hidden fees - here's exactly what you pay for"

### Proposal Success Factors

1. **Research their business** before the call
2. **Ask about their ideal customer** early
3. **Show relevant case studies** with similar companies
4. **Be specific about deliverables** and timelines
5. **State how ROI will be measured** explicitly
6. **Provide transparent pricing** with clear breakdown
7. **Offer flexible contract terms** to reduce risk
