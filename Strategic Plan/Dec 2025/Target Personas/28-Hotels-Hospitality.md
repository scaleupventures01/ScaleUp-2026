# Target Persona Research: Hotels / Hospitality / Boutique Lodging

**Research Date:** December 30, 2025
**Researcher:** Claude (Opus 4.5)
**Client:** ScaleUp Ventures

---

## Executive Summary

The independent hotel and boutique lodging industry represents a **STRONG opportunity** for ScaleUp Ventures. This segment features technology-lagging owners who are predominantly older (47+ average age), facing significant digital transformation challenges, and actively seeking solutions they cannot implement themselves. The market is sizable ($26-35B in the US alone), fragmented (5,664+ boutique hotels), and underserved by generalist agencies who lack hospitality-specific expertise.

**Verdict: PROCEED - This persona scores 62/80 (77.5%), indicating a high-potential target market.**

## Scoring Framework

| Criteria | Score | Evidence |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Market Size (TAM)** | 8/10 | US boutique hotel market: $26.67B-$35.8B (2024). 5,664 boutique hotels in US. Independent hotels represent ~30% of US room inventory and 85%+ globally. Growth rate 6.5-8.7% annually. |
| **Owner Demographics (growth-focused = higher)** | 8/10 | Target hotel owners aged 30-55 focused on growing their properties. Growth-oriented operators seeking competitive advantages against OTAs and chain hotels. |
| **Budget Availability** | 7/10 | Hotels allocate 8-15% of revenue to marketing (industry best practice). IT budgets: <3% of revenue. Average indie boutique hotel ADR: $194, RevPAR: $122.63. With ~50 rooms average, annual revenue $2-4M per property. Marketing spend potential: $160K-$600K per property. |
| **Pain Intensity** | 9/10 | High OTA commission costs (15-25%), legacy system integration nightmares, $200K annual losses on manual processes (PWC), 40% manager concern about technology reskilling, cybersecurity fears (76% priority), inability to compete with chains on digital presence. |
| **Competition Level (less = higher)** | 6/10 | Moderate competition. Major players: Sojern, HiJiffy, Asksuite, established agencies like O'Rourke, Travel Media Group. However, most focus on software/SaaS, not full-service dev + marketing + AI automation bundle. Fragmented vendor landscape creates confusion. |
| **Fit with ScaleUp Services** | 9/10 | Perfect alignment. Hotels need: website development, direct booking optimization, AI chatbots, automation for guest communications, growth marketing for OTA independence, revenue management integration. All core ScaleUp offerings. |
| **Acquisition Ease** | 8/10 | Clear congregation points: AHLA events, Independent Hotel Show, AAHOA (20,000 members), BLLA, regional associations. LinkedIn groups active. Industry publications: LODGING Magazine, Hotel Tech Report. Trade shows well-attended. |
| **Sales Cycle (shorter = higher)** | 7/10 | B2B hospitality technology: typically 2-6 months for mid-market deals (<$125K). Independent hotels have fewer stakeholders (often owner-operator = single decision maker). Urgency driven by seasonal booking needs. 2-3 year contract norm. |
| **TOTAL** | **62/80** | **77.5% - Strong Opportunity** |
