# Target Persona Analysis: Security Services / Guard Companies

## Executive Summary

**Industry**: Private Security Guard Services (NAICS 5616)
**Analysis Date**: December 30, 2025
**Recommendation**: STRONG CANDIDATE - Proceed with targeted outreach
**Total Score**: 58/80

The security guard services industry presents a compelling opportunity for ScaleUp Ventures. This is a large ($36-53B US market), fragmented industry dominated by small operators with thin margins. Owners are typically older (50s-60s), often from military/law enforcement backgrounds, and face significant technology disruption pressure from AI, robots, and drones. The industry is experiencing severe labor shortages (described as "the worst in years"), creating urgency for automation solutions. Most operators lack sophisticated digital presence and marketing capabilities, making them receptive to modernization services.

## Sales Approach Recommendations

### Messaging That Resonates

**Do Say**:
- "Reduce overtime costs with smarter scheduling"
- "Never miss a qualified applicant again"
- "Show clients exactly what their guards are doing"
- "Get more contracts without cold calling"
- "Look as professional as Allied Universal"

**Don't Say**:
- "Digital transformation"
- "AI will replace your guards"
- "Disruptive technology"
- "Growth hacking"
- Anything that feels too "tech bro"

### Ideal Entry Point

1. **Lead with pain**: Labor shortage, overtime costs, losing bids
2. **Small initial project**: Website refresh or local SEO audit ($3-5K)
3. **Demonstrate ROI**: Show new leads, reduced costs
4. **Expand relationship**: Add automation, ongoing marketing

### Decision-Making Process

- Owner/founder is typically sole decision maker (SMB)
- May consult operations manager or spouse
- Values trust and referrals heavily
- Wants to see similar clients/case studies
- 30-60 day decision cycle typical

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I get all my business from referrals" | "Referrals are great for now, but what happens when a major client leaves? We help you build a predictable pipeline." |
| "I don't trust technology companies" | "We're not selling you software - we're doing the work for you. You focus on guards, we focus on growth." |
| "My margins are too thin for marketing" | "Our clients typically see 3-5x ROI. One new $5K/month contract pays for a year of marketing." |
| "I tried a website before and it didn't work" | "A website alone doesn't generate leads. We combine it with SEO, Google Ads, and follow-up systems that actually convert." |

- Partner with industry software vendors (TrackTik, Silvertrac) for referrals
