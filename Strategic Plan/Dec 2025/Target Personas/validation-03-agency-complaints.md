## TOP COMPLAINTS ABOUT AGENCIES (Ranked by Frequency)

### 1. Over-Promising and Under-Delivering
**Evidence Level: VERY HIGH (25+ data points)**

**Direct Quotes:**
> "It was nothing but over-promise and under-deliver. We were anticipating getting anywhere from 25 to 30 leads a month and we didn't even get 5 leads." - Business owner (SureFireLocal)

> "If you over-promise, you better over-deliver and they over-promised and under-delivered. We're still having the same issues more than two years later." - Business owner (SureFireLocal)

> "I've given my hard earned money to companies promising more hires and so far out of 3 of them none of them have ever produced anything." - Manny Cepeda, Orchestra Owner (Alignable)

---

### 2. No ROI / Zero Business Results
**Evidence Level: VERY HIGH (30+ data points)**

**Direct Quotes:**
> "I Spent 20K-30K on marketing since I started my business. I got barely anything in return." - Reddit user (via Estrella Ventures)

> "I'm putting out all this money and I'm not getting a damn thing back." - Business owner (SureFireLocal)

> "Unfortunately, after months of consistent advertising and making adjustments to our content as they suggested we received literally no conversions (sales)." - Trustpilot reviewer (Thrive Agency)

> "Spending $2k/month on PPC plus $2k/month in agency fees for 6 months, receiving about 300 leads. ALL non-qualified, zero conversions." - Trustpilot reviewer (DMA)

> "Paid more than $4,000 for website development and digital marketing but received no completed drafts, NO website design, or NO deliverables." - Trustpilot reviewer (Student Marketing Agency)

**Case Study - Richard Fleming (Small Business Owner):**
Hired agency to promote $300 online course. After several months:
- Zero sales generated
- Zero calls scheduled (their own metric)
- Multiple tactical pivots with no iteration or learning
- Fleming concluded: "If measurements for competence or success aren't included in the contract, you can't enforce them."

### 3. Lack of Transparency / No Access to Data
**Evidence Level: HIGH (20+ data points)**

**Direct Quotes:**
> "We don't get any data from him...I wouldn't know if we got anything to show for it." - Business owner (SureFireLocal)

> "Nobody has delivered tangible results when it comes to building up our online presence." - Business owner (SureFireLocal)

> "Not once was a plan put in place to give me the tools to actually do anything on my own." - Reddit user (via Estrella Ventures)

**The Vendor Lock-In Problem:**
Agencies often withhold:
- Admin access to ad accounts
- Analytics logins
- Creative assets ownership
- Process documentation

This prevents clients from leaving or developing internal capabilities.

---

### 4. Cookie-Cutter / Generic Strategies
**Evidence Level: HIGH (20+ data points)**

**Direct Quotes:**
> "I have found most agency work to be very standard versions of a Facebook or Google Adwords campaign, while most creativity was devoted to their attempts to convince me it was profitable." - Stuart Archer Cohen (Alignable)

> "Agencies prioritize repeatable services for higher margins rather than understanding individual business needs. They are selling a solution without taking the time to understand the problem." - Tom Henell, LinkedIn

> "One-size-fits-all solutions that don't address the specific needs of the client. Every business is unique, and consulting services need to be tailored accordingly." - Consource.io

**Example of Misalignment:**
A client whose 90% of business came from referrals was advised to pursue social media for customer acquisition - a fundamental misunderstanding of their business model.

---

### 5. Junior Staff Doing the Work
**Evidence Level: HIGH (15+ data points)**

**Direct Quotes:**
> "Why am I paying a premium for junior consultants who don't know as much as my team?" - Common executive complaint (Consource.io)

> "One of the biggest frustrations business owners face is feeling like they've been passed off - meeting with a senior strategist during the pitch who clearly gets your business, and then once the contract is signed, suddenly working with someone new who doesn't seem fully up to speed." - SureFireLocal

**The Pyramid Problem:**
- Senior partners sell the project
- Mid-level managers oversee execution
- Junior staff (often fresh MBA grads) do the actual work
- Clients pay premium rates for entry-level execution

---

### 6. Poor Communication / Unresponsive Service
**Evidence Level: HIGH (15+ data points)**

**Direct Quotes:**
> "They just weren't there for me and...would never answer the phone or email me back." - Business owner (SureFireLocal)

> "Trying to get hold of real person is next to impossible if you are a paying customer. Support cancels tickets without any response or assistance." - Trustpilot reviewer

> "Emails would go out with ridiculous typos. Webpages would launch with ugly designs." - Richard Fleming

---

### 7. Agencies Focus on Deliverables, Not Outcomes
**Evidence Level: HIGH (15+ data points)**

**Expert Analysis:**
> "Deliverables have no value in themselves; it is the outcome that they provide that gives them value." - Paul Boag

> "In a service-centric approach, the agency emphasizes delivering a specific service, such as SEO or social media management. The focus is often on technical execution - producing high-quality deliverables efficiently and consistently...but may not take the time to align each post with the client's overarching brand goals." - Agency Analytics

> "Consultants deliver attractive strategies but fail to provide actionable implementation plans, leaving concepts unrealized." - Consource.io

**The Core Disconnect:**
Agencies measure success by:
- Blog posts published
- Ads run
- Reports delivered
- Hours billed

Clients measure success by:
- Revenue generated
- Leads converted
- Business growth achieved
- Problems solved

---

### 8. Expensive Fees with No Accountability
**Evidence Level: HIGH (15+ data points)**

**Direct Quotes:**
> "I trusted the wrong company and now I have to pay extra just to fix everything." - Business owner (SureFireLocal)

> "I've gotten screwed over by a bunch of them." - Business owner (SureFireLocal)

> "One client received a proposal costing $50,000 with 'no guaranty of registration whatsoever,' equating to $143 per attendee." - Philip Philbin (Alignable)

> "A roofing company was working with a local SEO company that charges roughly $5,000 a month for minimal effort and minimal content." - Mannix Marketing

---

### 9. Excuses and Blame-Shifting
**Evidence Level: MEDIUM (10+ data points)**

**Direct Quotes:**
> "Excuses for failure always come back to you. You didn't spend enough money. You didn't wait long enough, etc." - Stuart Archer Cohen (Alignable)

> "9 out of 10 times, the problem organisations face are caused by bad management decisions. It's always easier to blame the consultant when it fails - as it shifts the responsibility for the problem to an external source." - SpencerTom.com

**Common Agency Deflections:**
- "You need to increase your budget"
- "SEO takes 6-12 months to show results"
- "Your market is just very competitive"
- "Your internal team didn't implement our recommendations"

---

### 10. Scam / Fraudulent Practices
**Evidence Level: HIGH (15+ data points)**

**Statistics:**
- BBB receives 13,000+ complaints annually about SEO/web design scams
- Average small business loses $3,000-$5,000 to scams before realizing

**Common Scam Tactics:**
1. **Guaranteed Rankings**: "Anyone who says 'We guarantee a #1 ranking in one month' is scamming you."
2. **Fake Google Employees**: Scammers claim to manually adjust rankings for fees
3. **Cold Call Operations**: Reputable agencies don't cold-call nationally
4. **Bot Traffic**: Agencies send fake leads to inflate metrics
5. **No-Work Schemes**: Charging fees without login access to actually do work

**Direct Quotes:**
> "SCAM agency working under the umbrella of STUDENTS to get you on board. They claim they are doing something for you when actually the only thing they are good at is billing!" - Trustpilot reviewer

> "Lost $1,500...AVOID these scam artists at all costs." - Trustpilot reviewer

## QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE

### Industry Survey Data (2024)

| Metric | Finding | Source |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Clients switching agencies | 40% in next 6 months | Setup Survey 2024 |
| #1 reason for leaving | Dissatisfaction with Delivery (48%) | Setup Survey 2024 |
| YoY increase in delivery complaints | +14% | Setup Survey 2024 |
| Clients feeling misunderstood | +10 percentage points YoY | Setup Survey 2024 |
| Executives saying consultants added value | Only 35% | Source Global Research |
| Clients prioritizing value/ROI over cost | 90% | 4A's/ANA Joint Study |
| Agency churn rate (annual) | 15-25% | Swydo |

### Client-Agency Perception Gap

3. Dissatisfaction with Strategic Approach
4. Dissatisfaction with Value

**What agencies THINK causes breakups:**
1. Client leadership changes

## DO CLIENTS FEEL THEY PAID FOR DELIVERABLES WITHOUT ROI?

**ANSWER: YES - EMPHATICALLY VALIDATED**

### Evidence Summary:

1. **"Dissatisfaction with Delivery"** is the #1 reason clients leave (48%), yet agencies rank it lower - proving agencies focus on what they deliver, not what clients receive.

2. **90% of clients prioritize overall value and long-term ROI over cost** - they're willing to pay more for outcomes, but agencies sell activities.

3. **Direct testimony pattern**: Business owners consistently describe paying for:
   - Blog posts that didn't generate leads
   - Ads that didn't convert
   - SEO that didn't rank
   - Strategies that weren't implemented
   - Reports no one read

4. **The fundamental disconnect**: Agencies measure internal metrics (hours, deliverables, campaigns launched) while clients measure business outcomes (revenue, leads, growth).

### Representative Quote:
> "Nothing is a waste of money if you measure its ROI...Trouble is, many agencies still don't measure, or can't measure, or don't want to measure." - Ken Abbott, Internet Marketing Expert

## HOW COMMON IS AGENCY DISSATISFACTION?

**ANSWER: EXTREMELY COMMON - Industry-Wide Problem**

### Prevalence Indicators:

| Indicator | Data Point |
|-----------|------------|
| Clients ready to switch | 40% in next 6 months |
| Executives dissatisfied with consulting value | 65% |
| Industry churn rate | 15-25% annually |
| Brands ready to dump agencies | ~40% |
| CX quality decline | 3 consecutive years |
| Brands with significant CSAT declines | Over 25% |
| Brands that improved | Less than 10% |

### Systemic Nature of the Problem:

The problem is structural, not isolated:
- **Agencies optimize for their margins**, not client outcomes
- **Junior staff execution** at senior rates
- **Cookie-cutter playbooks** applied regardless of fit
- **No accountability mechanisms** in contracts
- **Misaligned incentives**: agencies profit from ongoing retainers, not solved problems
