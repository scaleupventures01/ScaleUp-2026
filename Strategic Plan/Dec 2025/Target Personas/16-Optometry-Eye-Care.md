# Target Persona Analysis: Optometry / Eye Care Practices

**Analysis Date**: December 30, 2025
**Industry**: Healthcare - Optometry / Eye Care Services

---

## Executive Summary

The optometry/eye care industry presents a **MODERATELY STRONG** opportunity for ScaleUp Ventures. With ~29,000 practices generating $21.5B annually, this fragmented market of independent practitioners faces mounting pressure from private equity consolidation, declining reimbursements, and online retail competition. While specialized marketing agencies exist, significant gaps remain in comprehensive dev/growth/AI services. The average owner age of 44 years and documented technology resistance create openings for modernization partners.
