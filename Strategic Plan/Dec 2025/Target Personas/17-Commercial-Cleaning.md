## Recommendations

### Viability Assessment: PROCEED

This industry scores **58/80** and shows strong potential with some caveats:

**Strengths:**
- Massive, fragmented market ($108B, 1M+ businesses)
- Aging owner demographic desperate for succession/modernization
- Clear pain points that technology can solve
- Established acquisition channels (associations, conferences)
- High service fit across all ScaleUp offerings

**Concerns:**
- Existing specialized competition (8-10 agencies)
- Thin margins may limit budget for larger engagements
- Technology resistance in some segments
- Sales cycle may be longer for trust-building

### Recommended Approach

1. **Niche within niche:** Focus on mid-size operators ($500K-$3M revenue) who have budget but lack enterprise solutions
2. **Lead with AI:** Differentiate from existing agencies through AI/automation expertise
3. **Productize offerings:** Create cleaning-specific packages (e.g., "Janitorial AI Starter Kit")
4. **Conference strategy:** Exhibit or speak at BSCAI Contracting Success (Nov 2025)
5. **Case study development:** Land 2-3 reference clients before broad outreach

### Engagement Tiers

|------|--------|---------------|----------|
| Starter | $250K-500K revenue | $1,500-3,000 | Website + Local SEO + Basic Automation |
