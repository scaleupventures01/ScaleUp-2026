# Target Persona Analysis: Self-Storage Facilities Industry

**Analysis Date:** December 30, 2025
**Analyst:** ScaleUp Ventures Research
**Industry:** Self-Storage Facilities

## Executive Summary

The self-storage industry represents a **strong opportunity** for ScaleUp Ventures. With 65-73% of facilities owned by independent "mom-and-pop" operators, a median owner age of ~50, and documented technology struggles, this industry fits the technology-cautious profile. The $44B U.S. market faces intense REIT consolidation pressure, creating urgency for independents to modernize or sell. Key pain points align directly with ScaleUp's dev, growth marketing, and AI/automation services.
