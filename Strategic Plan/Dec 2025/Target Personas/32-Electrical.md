## Recommended Approach

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) for ScaleUp
- **Company size**: 5-25 employees
- **Annual revenue**: $500K-$5M
- **Owner age**: 50-65 years
- **Current digital presence**: Weak or nonexistent
- **Pain points**: Struggling to compete online, facing succession planning, labor shortage
- **Geography**: Urban/suburban markets with competition

### Positioning Recommendations
1. **Lead with the succession angle**: "Prepare your business for sale or transfer with modern systems"
2. **Emphasize labor shortage solution**: "AI handles admin work so your team focuses on billable hours"
3. **Speak their language**: Avoid tech jargon, focus on "more calls" and "less paperwork"
4. **Use ROI language**: "X dollars in marketing = Y qualified leads"

### Entry Points
1. **Association partnerships**: Sponsor NECA/IEC events, advertise in trade publications
2. **Forum engagement**: Build credibility on ElectricianTalk.com
3. **Referral programs**: Incentivize existing clients to refer contractors
4. **Facebook targeting**: Ads to electrical contractor audiences
5. **Local Service Ads management**: Quick-win service to prove value

### Potential Objections and Responses
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I've been doing fine with word-of-mouth" | "97% of customers now search online first. Your competitors are capturing leads you never see." |
| "I don't have time for marketing" | "That's exactly why we handle everything. You focus on the work; we bring the leads." |
| "Technology is too complicated" | "We make it simple. Our clients average 58 years old and love the results." |
| "I'm planning to retire soon anyway" | "A modern digital presence increases your business value for sale by 15-30%." |
