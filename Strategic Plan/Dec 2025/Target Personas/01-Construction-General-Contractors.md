**Analysis Date**: December 30, 2025
**Analyst**: ScaleUp Ventures Strategy Team
**Purpose**: Evaluate Construction/General Contractors as target persona for dev, growth marketing, and AI/automation services

---

## Executive Summary

**Verdict**: STRONG CANDIDATE - Proceed with targeted outreach

## Scoring Framework

| Criteria | Score | Evidence |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Market Size (TAM potential)** | 9/10 | $2.2T industry, 3.97M businesses, 814K with employees. Massive addressable market with fragmented ownership structure ideal for service providers. |
