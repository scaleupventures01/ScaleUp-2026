- **40% of SMBs who outsource marketing churn** from their agency relationship
- **56% of that churn happens within 6-12 months** - agencies have a tiny window to prove value

## Section 1: What Specific Evidence SMBs Look For Before Hiring

### Primary Evidence Requirements

| Evidence Type | Priority Level | SMB Expectation |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Case Studies with Real Metrics | Critical | Specific results, named clients, verifiable outcomes |
| Client Testimonials | Critical | Detailed stories, not generic praise |
| Online Reviews | High | Multi-platform presence (Google, Clutch, G2) |
| Industry Experience | High | Track record in their specific vertical |
| Reference Calls | High | Direct conversations with past clients |
| Certification/Partnerships | Medium | Google Partner, HubSpot, verified badges |
| Sample Reports | Medium | Walkthrough of actual deliverables |
| Agency's Own Marketing | Medium | "Can they market themselves effectively?" |

### Questions SMBs Ask Before Hiring (Top 10)

Based on research from Duct Tape Marketing and industry sources:

1. **"Who owns my marketing assets and accounts?"**
   - SMBs want ownership; agencies should only have manager access

2. **"How will you measure success and how often will we review it?"**
   - Expectation: Clear metrics + regular review meetings, not just monthly reports

3. **"How do you connect tactics to strategy?"**
   - One business owner reported wasting "$100,000 on bringing in marketers" without strategy

4. **"What happens if I want to end the contract?"**
   - Strong preference for month-to-month over long-term lock-ins

5. **"Who will I actually work with day-to-day?"**
   - SMBs want to meet the actual team, not just the salesperson

6. **"How do you report on results, and can I see a sample?"**
   - Request for example reports with walkthrough explanations

7. **"How do you integrate AI and what remains human-led?"**
   - Expectation: "AI plus human" approach, not full automation

8. **"How do you ensure my team stays involved and informed?"**
   - Red flag: Agencies saying they'll "just handle it"

9. **"What's your process for creating strategy before execution?"**
   - Demand for strategy-first approach before any tactical work

10. **"What will you teach me along the way?"**
    - Best agencies "educate and empower clients"

### How SMBs Verify Claims

**Direct Verification Methods:**
- Visit clients' websites to confirm businesses exist
- Reach out to past clients privately
- Check third-party review sites (Google, Clutch, Trustpilot, G2)
- Verify certifications via Google Partner directory, HubSpot directory
- Use SEMrush or Ahrefs to independently verify SEO claims

**Red Flags That Disqualify Agencies:**
- Testimonials that "all sound suspiciously similar"
- Case studies lacking specific details or metrics
- Prices significantly below industry standards
- Guaranteed results by specific dates
- Unable to provide verifiable references
- Pushing proposals after only one meeting

## Section 2: Trust Signals That Matter Most to Burned Clients

### The Four Pillars of Trust (ConsultingQuest Research)

| Pillar | Definition | What Burned Clients Look For |
|--------|------------|------------------------------|
| **Benevolence** | Prioritizing client success over profits | "Do they adapt to my changing priorities or push their agenda?" |
| **Integrity** | Honest communication about feasibility | "Will they tell me what I need to hear, not what I want to hear?" |
| **Competence** | Expertise applied to unique challenges | "Do they acknowledge limitations or claim to do everything?" |
| **Predictability** | Reliable deadline and promise-keeping | "Can I count on them to deliver what they promised, when promised?" |

### Trust Signals Ranked by Importance

**Tier 1: Non-Negotiable (Must Have)**
1. **Transparent, data-driven reporting** - Regular updates clients can actually understand
2. **Clear ownership terms** - Client owns all assets and accounts
3. **Strategy-first approach** - No tactics without documented strategy
4. **Flexible contracts** - Month-to-month or easy exit clauses
5. **Quick wins visible early** - Demonstrated value within 90 days

**Tier 2: High Priority**
6. **Industry specialization** - Deep expertise in client's vertical
7. **Accessible team members** - Meet the people doing the work
8. **Educational approach** - Teaching, not just doing
9. **Third-party validation** - Reviews on independent platforms
10. **Reference availability** - Willing to connect with past clients

**Tier 3: Important Differentiators**
11. **Partnership certifications** - Google, HubSpot, Meta verified
12. **Content quality** - Blog, thought leadership demonstrates expertise
13. **Clear pricing structure** - No hidden fees or unclear retainers
14. **Communication protocols** - Defined touchpoints and escalation paths
15. **Values alignment** - Cultural fit and shared business philosophy

### What Destroys Trust (Primary Causes of Bad Experiences)

Based on research from multiple sources:

| Trust Destroyer | Frequency | Impact |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| Lack of Communication | Very Common | Clients feel "in the dark" about their investment |
| Unmet Promises | Very Common | Guarantees about growth that never materialize |
| Poor ROI / No Results | Very Common | 60% of churn tied to perceived lack of value |
| Hidden Fees | Common | Fee inflation discovered after engagement |
| High Turnover | Common | Different account managers every few months |
| No Clear Strategy | Common | Tactics without direction |
| Inconsistent Branding | Moderate | Diluted brand messages across materials |
| "Black Box Syndrome" | Moderate | Project disappears with no visibility |

### What Burned Clients Do Differently

After a negative agency experience, SMBs typically:

1. **Generalize distrust to all agencies** - "I don't like agencies" or "agencies don't do anything"
2. **Bring marketing in-house** - Even when underqualified, to maintain control
3. **Demand proof before commitment** - Higher evidence bar for next partner
4. **Require shorter contracts** - Month-to-month or 90-day maximums
5. **Ask more detailed questions** - About billing, delivery models, limitations
6. **Seek referrals over marketing** - Trust peer recommendations over agency claims
7. **Test with small projects first** - Pilot before full engagement

## Section 3: How SMBs Verify ROI Claims Before Engaging

### The ROI Verification Challenge

**Key Statistic:** 60% of SMBs who churned cited "didn't feel like they were getting adequate ROI" - this is **double** the rate from 2023.

**The Trust Gap:** SMBs struggle to verify ROI claims because:
- Most agencies charge for time (retainers/hourly), not results
- Marketing results often take 6+ months to materialize
- SMBs lack tools/expertise to independently verify claims
- Case studies are hard to validate without contacting references

### Methods SMBs Use to Verify ROI Claims

**Before Engagement:**

| Method | Effectiveness | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Reference Calls | High | Direct questions: "Did they deliver what they promised? Would you hire again?" |
| Case Study Verification | High | Request specifics: exact metrics, timeframes, contact info for client |
| Free Audit/Consultation | Medium-High | Test their thinking before committing money |
| Third-Party Reviews | Medium | G2, Clutch, Trustpilot for unbiased feedback |
| Independent Analysis | Medium | Use SEMrush/Ahrefs to verify SEO claims independently |
| Trial/Pilot Project | High | 1-3 month limited engagement before full commitment |

**Questions for ROI Verification:**

1. "What specific metrics improved for clients like me?"
2. "Can I speak directly with a past client in my industry?"
3. "What's your average client retention rate?"
4. "How long until I should expect to see results?"
5. "What happens if we don't hit targets?"
6. "How do you define and measure success?"
7. "What percentage of your clients achieve the ROI you promise?"

### The Pilot Project Approach

**Research Finding:** "POCs show that technology works in a vacuum. Pilots prove that technology changes the business."

**Why Pilots Work:**
- Time-boxed (1-3 months) reduces financial risk
- Attacks a visible business constraint (hours, errors, revenue)
- Creates proof, not promises
- Builds trust through demonstrated results
- Makes budget conversations easier with documented ROI

**Pilot Project Best Practices:**
- Define success criteria before launch
- Establish clear timelines and milestones
- Document roles and responsibilities
- Focus on quick wins that prove concept
- Measure against agreed KPIs
- Provide transparent reporting throughout

### ROI Calculation Framework SMBs Expect

**Standard Formula:**
```
ROI = (Revenue from Marketing - Marketing Cost) / Marketing Cost x 100
```

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Agencies recommend SMBs should target minimum **3:1 ROI**
- Top-performing companies achieve **5.9% average ROI** on marketing projects
- Best-in-class achieve **13% ROI** (more than double average)

**Costs SMBs Want Tracked:**
- Advertising spend
- Agency fees
- Content creation costs
- Technology/platform costs
- Internal time investment

**Results SMBs Want Measured:**
- Lead generation volume
- Conversion rates
- Revenue attributed to marketing
- Customer acquisition cost
- Customer lifetime value increase
