# Ralph Loop: Phase 4 - Industry Personas Rewrite

## Mission
Contextually rewrite all 40 Industry Persona files to reflect the new 30-55 growth-focused audience mindset. Apply the same transformation used in Phases 1-3. This is the largest phase - systematic batch processing is essential.

## Content Transformation Matrix

### The Audience Shift (Same as Phases 1-3)

| Dimension | OLD (Remove) | NEW (Apply) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Age References** | 50-65, 55+, older, 50-88 | 30-55, growth-stage |
| **Primary Motivation** | Fear of being left behind, Exit planning | Growth & competitive edge, Scaling |
| **Tech Relationship** | Technology laggards, Can't do it themselves | Growth-focused, Time-constrained |
| **Business Mode** | Winding down, Legacy, Retirement | Building/scaling, Market expansion |
| **Pain Points** | "Burned by consultants", Fear | "Too busy to implement", Opportunity cost |
| **Decision Style** | Risk-averse, Hand-holding | Data-driven, Want proof |
| **Success Metric** | Stability, Not losing | Growth rate, Competitive advantage |

### Persona-Specific Transformations

Each persona file contains these sections that need updating:

#### 1. Owner Demographics Section
**FIND patterns like:**
- "Average age: 48-58 years"
- "50%+ of owners are 55+"
- "52% of all owners are aged 50-88"
- "older = higher" in scoring criteria
- "tech laggard industry"

**REPLACE with:**
- "Average age: 35-50 years"
- "Majority of owners are 30-55"
- "Growth-focused owners scaling their businesses"
- "time-constrained = higher" in scoring criteria
- "growth-focused industry"

#### 2. Technology Comfort Section
**FIND patterns like:**
- "struggle with technology"
- "fear of technology"
- "can't modernize themselves"
- "historically low tech adoption"

**REPLACE with:**
- "too time-constrained to implement themselves"
- "focused on core operations"
- "need execution capacity, not hand-holding"
- "recognize competitive advantage of digital"

#### 3. Pain Points Section
**FIND patterns like:**
- "fear of being left behind"
- "burned by agencies before"
- "don't understand technology"

**REPLACE with:**
- "opportunity cost of delay"
- "want proof before committing"
- "need to see the ROI first"

#### 4. Messaging/Voice Section
**FIND patterns like:**
- "reassure fearful owners"
- "patient hand-holding"
- "protect their legacy"

**REPLACE with:**
- "show proof to data-driven owners"
- "provide execution capacity"
- "accelerate their growth"

#### 5. Scoring Framework
**UPDATE the criteria:**
- "Owner Demographics (older = higher)" → "Owner Demographics (time-constrained = higher)"
- Adjust age-based scoring rationale to focus on growth stage, not age

---

## Execution Process

```
FOR each batch (1-5):
    FOR each persona file in batch:
        1. Read current document
        2. Identify old-audience patterns in:
           - Executive Summary
           - Owner Demographics section
           - Technology Adoption section
           - Pain Points section
           - Messaging section
           - Scoring rationale
        3. Contextually rewrite (NOT mechanical find/replace):
           a. Update age references (30-55)
           b. Transform fear-based → growth-based framing
           c. Shift "can't do tech" → "time-constrained"
           d. Update scoring criteria rationale
        4. Preserve industry-specific data (TAM, market size, associations)
        5. Write updated document
        6. Mark document complete
    END FOR
    Log batch completion
END FOR
```

---

## Batch Processing Strategy

Given 40 files, process in batches of 8 with progress checkpoints:

### Checkpoint Protocol
After each batch:
1. Run validation grep on completed batch
2. Log any issues found
3. Update progress tracker
4. Proceed to next batch

### Efficiency Tips
- Many persona files share identical structure
- Age demographics section is usually in same location
- Scoring framework is always near top
- Use batch `replace_all` for common phrases across files

---

## Common Patterns Across All 40 Files

### Universal Find/Replace (can apply to all)

| Find | Replace |
|------|---------|
| `Owner Demographics (older = higher)` | `Owner Demographics (growth-focused = higher)` |
| `50%+ of owners are 55+` | `Majority of owners are 30-55 and growth-focused` |
| `52% of all owners are aged 50-88` | `Target owners aged 30-55 scaling their businesses` |
| `tech laggard` | `growth-focused` |
| `struggle with technology` | `time-constrained for implementation` |
| `fear of technology` | `focused on core operations` |
| `burned by agencies` | `want proof before committing` |
| `modernize or be left behind` | `capture competitive advantage` |
| `exit planning` | `growth planning` |
| `sell for more later` | `scale faster now` |

### Preserve (Do NOT Change)
- Industry-specific statistics (TAM, market size, growth rates)
- Association names and membership numbers
- Competitor names and market data
- Revenue ranges and budget percentages
- Sales cycle timelines
- Scoring numbers (just update rationale)

---

## Definition of Done

A persona file is COMPLETE when:
- [ ] Age references updated to 30-55 range
- [ ] "Owner Demographics" scoring rationale updated
- [ ] No "tech laggard", "burned by", "55+", "exit planning" language
- [ ] Growth/scaling motivation prominent
- [ ] Time-constrained (not tech-incompetent) framing
- [ ] Industry-specific data preserved
- [ ] Document structure maintained

---

## Validation Checklist

After ALL 40 files are complete:

```bash
# Should return 0 results
grep -ri "tech laggard\|burned by agencies\|55-65\|50-88\|older = higher\|exit planning\|can't modernize" "Strategic Plan/Dec 2025/Target Personas/"

# Should return multiple results (new language)
grep -ri "30-55\|growth-focused\|time-constrained\|competitive advantage\|want proof" "Strategic Plan/Dec 2025/Target Personas/"
```

### Per-Batch Validation
After each batch of 8, run quick validation:
```bash
grep -ri "tech laggard\|50-88\|older = higher" [batch files]
```

---

## Completion Promise

When Phase 4 is complete, output:

```
<promise>PHASE4_INDUSTRY_PERSONAS_COMPLETE</promise>
```

This signals ALL 65 documents are now aligned.

## Notes

- This is CONTEXTUAL rewriting - preserve industry-specific value
- Each persona has unique industry data - preserve all statistics
- Scoring numbers stay the same - only rationale changes
- When in doubt: "Would a 40-year-old CEO scaling this business find this compelling?"
- Process in batches to maintain quality and allow checkpoints
- 40 files is substantial - systematic approach essential
