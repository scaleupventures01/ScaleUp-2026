## OfferPath - 2025-12-30
**Status:** KILLED
**Category:** Product
**Rank:** N/A
**Score:** N/A
**Owner:** N/A
**Decision Date:** 2026-01-08

### The Idea
B2C job application service. Was in conversion validation phase.

### Decision: KILLED

**Reason:** Strategic misfit. Not pursuing.

### Factors Behind Decision
1. **Price competition:** Scale.jobs offers 800 apps for $299 vs. our $1,148 (4x cheaper)
2. **Operational burden:** High human involvement doesn't fit portfolio strategy
3. **Better alternatives:** Higher-margin businesses with less manual work available
4. **Founder interest:** Not interested in pursuing this market

### Competitive Analysis (Scale.jobs)
| Metric | Scale.jobs | Our Model |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| 800 apps | $299 | $1,148 |
| Apps/month | 50-100 | 400 |
| Time to complete | 8-16 months | 2 months |
| Effective $/app | $1.00-2.00 | $1.44-2.87 |

*We're faster but can't compete on price. Market wants cheap, not fast.*

### Historical Metrics (for reference)
- CAC: $302 (18% under $368 max)
- Gross Margin: 53%
- LTV:CAC: 2.1x

**Quadrant:** KILLED
**Resources redirected to:** Prevyu and ScaleUp Consulting

### Key Factor
Personal use first, validate later.

### Priority Scoring
| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Impact | 5 | Personal value, unclear commercial |
| Effort | 5 | Side project, when time permits |
| **Priority** | **5.0** | Parked until bandwidth |

**Category:** Service/Product
**Rank:** #5

| Effort | 6 | Would need to hire help |
| **Priority** | **4.0** | Parked - Q3+ earliest |

## 3D Printer Business - 2026-01-04
**Status:** Backlog
**Category:** Product / Side Hustle
**Rank:** #7
**Score:** 5.0/10
**Owner:** Founder + Son

### The Idea
Father/son side hustle creating and selling 3D printed products on Etsy, Amazon, and TikTok Shop. Already own Bambu P1S Combo. Son (10) has 3 years of printing experience. Still exploring what product categories fit best (home decor, toys, tech accessories, niche hobby items).

### Key Factor
Family bonding is the primary value. Teaching son entrepreneurship while building a small passive income stream. Low financial risk (<$100 startup beyond existing equipment).

### Priority Scoring
| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Impact | 4 | Low revenue ceiling (<$500/mo), family bonding value |
| Effort (inverted) | 7 | Already have equipment, son helps, <$100 startup |
| Financial Viability | 4.3 | Quick break-even, low revenue target, unknown confidence |
| **Priority** | **5.0** | Fill-in when experimenting with son |

### Financial Viability Breakdown
| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Time to Break-even | 8 | <$100 startup, few sales to break even |
| Probable Revenue | 2 | Under $500/month target |
| Revenue Confidence | 3 | Unknown - haven't done the math |
| **Avg Financial Score** | **4.3** | |

### Key Risks
1. Finding what sells - still exploring categories - M
2. Time vs. return - low ceiling for effort - L
3. Quality/consistency while still learning - M

### Unique Value
- Son has 3 years printing experience (more than founder!)
- Already experimenting with prints
- Family bonding + teaching entrepreneurship
- Multiple sales channels available (Etsy, Amazon, TikTok Shop)

**Quadrant:** Fill-in
**Next Milestone:** Continue experimenting, find what sells, list first products when ready
**Timeline:** Already experimenting - opportunistic

## AI Influencer (Curvy Black Woman) - 2026-01-04
**Status:** Backlog
**Category:** Content/Creator Economy
**Rank:** #8
**Score:** 4.7/10
**Owner:** Founder + Upwork

### The Idea
AI-generated influencer featuring a realistic, relatable curvy Black woman with authentic hobbies (fitness, 3D printing). Monetized through views/ad revenue and subscription content (edgy but not NSFW). Fills representation gap in mostly-white AI influencer market.

### Key Factor
Legitimate opportunity but timing/resources constrained. Needs research sprint before committing.

### Priority Scoring
| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Impact | 6 | Passive income potential, transferable skills |
| Effort | 6 | Technical learning curve, time-constrained |
| **Priority** | **5.0** | Park until Q2 2026 after higher priorities stabilize |

### Validated Elements
- Clear differentiation (representation gap)
- Ethical framework defined (transparent, no solicitation)
- Risk tolerance established (3 months + $300)
- Success metric defined ($500/month net profit)

### Information Gaps
- Platform selection (Instagram? TikTok? Other?)
- AI imagery tools, costs, learning curve
- Realistic content production workflow
- Timeline to first revenue

### Ethical Guardrails
- Transparent AI disclosure
- No direct money solicitation
- Entertainment framing (not relationship)
- Edgy but not NSFW content

### Monetization Guardrails
- Free content primary (ad-revenue model)
- If subscriptions: cheap only ($3-5/month max)
- No tipping/donations (disabled)
- Product promotion/affiliate only (fitness gear, 3D printing, etc.)

**Quadrant:** Research First
**Next Milestone:** 2-4 hour research sprint on AI tools and competitor analysis before any commitment
**Decision Gate:** After research - is this achievable in 2-5 hrs/week with $50-100/month?

## Vending Machines - 2026-01-04
**Status:** Backlog
**Category:** Passive Income
**Rank:** #9
**Score:** 4.2/10
**Owner:** Founder + Hire Out

### The Idea
Purchase 1-5 vending machines as a passive income side hustle. Hire out restocking/operations to keep time commitment minimal (1-2 hrs/week).

### Key Factor
Low-effort diversification play. Small scale test, proven model, but low revenue ceiling at target scale.

### Priority Scoring
| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Impact | 3 | Under $500/mo target, small scale |
| Effort (inverted) | 6 | Low capital, hire out operations |
| Financial Viability | 4 | 6-12 month break-even, low revenue |
| **Priority** | **4.2** | Fill-in when bandwidth permits |

### Financial Viability Breakdown
| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Time to Break-even | 5 | 6-12 months per machine |
| Probable Revenue | 2 | Under $500/month target |
| Revenue Confidence | 5 | Proven model, location-dependent |
| **Avg Financial Score** | **4.0** | |

### Key Risks
1. Location acquisition - finding high-traffic spots is hard - M
2. Low margin per machine at small scale - L
3. Competition for good locations - M

**Quadrant:** Fill-in
**Next Milestone:** Opportunistic - when right deal/location appears
**Management:** Hire out restocking and operations

## Real Estate Investing - 2026-01-04
**Status:** Backlog (Capital Constrained)
**Category:** Passive Income / Wealth Building
**Rank:** #10
**Score:** 4.1/10
**Owner:** Founder + Property Manager

### The Idea
Single-family or small multi-family (2-4 unit) rental property investing. Focus on appreciation over cash flow. Hire property management to keep hands-off.

### Key Factor
Capital constraint (<$50K) significantly limits options. Good for long-term wealth building but not actionable until capital increases or creative financing is found.

### Priority Scoring
| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Impact | 5 | Appreciation focus, diversification |
| Effort (inverted) | 3 | Capital constraint, financing complexity |
| Financial Viability | 4 | Slow break-even, minimal cash flow |
| **Priority** | **4.1** | Park until capital situation improves |

### Financial Viability Breakdown
| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Time to Break-even | 3 | Appreciation play = 12-18+ months |
| Probable Revenue | 3 | Not cash flow focused |
| Revenue Confidence | 5 | Medium research, no experience |
| **Avg Financial Score** | **3.7** | |

### Key Risks
1. Capital requirements - under $50K limits options significantly - H
2. Market timing - rates, prices, recession risk - M
3. Tenant/management hassles - even with PM - M

### Why It's Attractive
- Diversification from tech/consulting income
- Long-term wealth building
- Potential market opportunity (if rates drop)

**Quadrant:** Avoid (for now) - Capital constraint is blocking
**Next Milestone:** Opportunistic - revisit when capital >$100K or creative financing opportunity appears
**Management:** Would hire property manager

## Copycat + 1 Business (Shutdown Arbitrage) - 2026-01-08
**Status:** Backlog
**Category:** Venture / Meta-Strategy
**Rank:** #6
**Score:** 5.5/10
**Owner:** Founder

### The Idea
"Fast follower" strategy with two angles: (1) Shutdown Arbitrage - monitor VC-backed businesses shutting down, acquire learnings/tech/talent, relaunch improved version; (2) Competitive Improvement - study existing businesses, identify weaknesses, build better version. Founder operates the relaunched business directly.

### Problem & Audience
Customer depends on which company is relaunched. Model targets the market gap left by validated-but-failed startups. Example: Freeman Capital (wealth management for first-time investors) shut down despite traction - could be relaunched with improvements.

### Differentiation
- No one has formalized "shutdown arbitrage" as a deliberate, repeatable strategy
- Acqui-hirers want talent, PE wants cash flow - this targets full relaunch
- Specific targeting by stage/size, industry focus, cost structure, and speed (details TBD)

### Founder Qualifications
- Raised VC before
- Techstars alumnus
- Multiple businesses (failures and successes)
- Due diligence experience on businesses

### Market Validation
- 364 startup shutdowns in 2024 (up 56% from 2023)
- Series A failures jumped from 6% to 14% (more validated businesses failing)
- Asset acquisition happening (Mendaera/Avail, Fusion Labs/Qredo)
- CB Insights has 483 startup failure post-mortems as research material

### Viability Assessment
| Dimension | Score (1-10) | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Viability | 6 | Strong market signal, but success = finding right opportunity |
| Strategic Fit | 5 | Separate from Heron, competes for founder attention |
| **Overall** | **5.5** | |

### Top Risks
1. Finding the right opportunity - H (needle in haystack)
2. Execution complexity - H (each relaunch = new business)
3. Competition from acqui-hirers/PE - M (they have more capital)

### Effort Estimate
**Small** (to test) - Can start with research and opportunity identification before committing capital. Each actual relaunch would be Medium-Large.

### Recommendation
**PARK** - Interesting model with real market validation and strong founder credentials. But no urgency, multiple high-severity risks, and competes for founder attention against ScaleUp and Prevyu. Revisit when core priorities are stable.

**Quadrant:** Research/Park
**Next Milestone:** Q3 2026+ - opportunistic if compelling shutdown appears
**Trigger to Activate:** Core priorities (ScaleUp, Prevyu) stabilized AND high-quality shutdown opportunity identified
