## Executive Summary

An AI-generated influencer concept featuring a realistic, relatable curvy Black woman with authentic hobbies (fitness, 3D printing). The idea targets an underserved representation gap in the mostly-white AI influencer market, monetizing through views/ad revenue and subscription content (edgy but not NSFW). The founder has limited resources (2-10 hrs/week, $50-100/month) but is willing to risk 3 months and $300 to validate. Ethical guardrails are in place: transparent AI disclosure, no direct money solicitation, entertainment framing.

## Strategic Goals

### Validation Goal (3 months)
Prove the concept can generate any revenue while staying within ethical guardrails.

### Success Definition
Profitable = covers tools + outsourced staff + $500/month net income

### Key Success Metrics
1. Speed to first revenue (priority #1)
2. Passive income potential (eventual goal)
3. Transferable skills learned

---

## Decision Context

### Risk Tolerance
- **Willing to lose**: 3 months of effort + $300
- **Approach**: Moderate risk, focused validation test
- **Style**: Quick validation, not slow burn

### Ethical Framework
| Guardrail | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Transparency | Will disclose as AI character |
| No direct solicitation | Won't ask followers for money directly |
| Entertainment framing | Positioned as entertainment, not relationship |
| Content limits | Edgy but not NSFW (also limits brand deals) |

### Decision Criteria (Ranked)
1. **Speed to first revenue** - Wants quick validation
2. **Passive income potential** - Must eventually be hands-off
3. **Learning new skills** - Transferable to other ventures

---

## Resources & Constraints

### Available Resources
- **Budget**: $50-100/month (shared with other ventures)
- **Time**: 2-10 hrs/week (shared with other ventures)
- **Skills**: Willingness to learn, can hire Upwork contractors
- **Equipment**: None

### Key Constraints
1. **Technical** - AI imagery creation is primary challenge
2. **Time** - Very limited bandwidth
3. **Budget** - Minimal investment capacity
4. **Platform knowledge** - Gap identified

## Information Gaps

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Platform selection | HIGH | Which platform(s) to focus on? Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, OnlyFans-adjacent? |
| AI imagery tools | HIGH | Which tools? Cost? Learning curve? Quality achievable? |
| Realistic timeline to first revenue | MEDIUM | How long before ads/subscriptions generate income? |
| Content production workflow | MEDIUM | How many hours per post? Batch production possible? |
| Outsourcing options | MEDIUM | What can be delegated to Upwork? At what cost? |
| Platform TOS risks | MEDIUM | What are the rules around AI-generated influencer content? |

## Viability Assessment

### Strategic Fit Score: 5/10

| Factor | Score | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Alignment with goals | 7 | Passive income goal fits, but diverts from core priorities |
| Resource fit | 4 | Very constrained budget/time; shared with higher-priority ventures |
| Skill fit | 4 | Technical gap is significant; requires learning curve |
| Risk profile | 6 | Acceptable risk tolerance; 3-month test is reasonable |
| Opportunity cost | 4 | Time spent here = time not spent on ScaleUp, Prevyu, OfferPath |

### Viability Score: 5.5/10

| Factor | Score | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Market opportunity | 7 | Real gap exists; growing market |
| Differentiation | 7 | Clear positioning vs. competition |
| Technical feasibility | 5 | AI tools exist but learning curve unknown |
| Revenue path clarity | 5 | Multiple paths but timeline uncertain |
| Resource sufficiency | 4 | Very thin margins on time/money |
| Scalability | 6 | Could become passive; outsourceable |

### Top 3 Risks

1. **Technical barrier underestimated** - AI imagery may require more skill, time, or money than expected
2. **Opportunity cost** - 2-10 hrs/week pulled from ScaleUp (cash engine) or Prevyu (passion/freedom goal)
3. **Slow audience building** - Revenue may take 6-12+ months, not 3 months

---

## Preliminary Recommendation

### Verdict: PARK (Conditional Pursue)

**Reasoning**:

This is a legitimate business idea with real market opportunity and clear differentiation. The founder has thoughtfully considered ethics and set appropriate guardrails. However:

1. **Timing is wrong** - Current priorities (ScaleUp, Prevyu, OfferPath decision by Jan 31) are higher-impact and already in motion
2. **Resources are already stretched** - 2-10 hrs/week and $50-100/month are already allocated to existing ventures
3. **Technical gap needs research first** - Before committing 3 months, spend 2-4 hours researching AI imagery tools, costs, and realistic workflows

### Suggested Path Forward

**Phase 0: Research Sprint (Before Committing)**
- 2-4 hours of research on AI imagery tools (Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc.)
- Identify 3-5 successful AI influencer accounts; reverse-engineer their approach
- Determine platform (likely Instagram or TikTok based on audience)
- Estimate realistic content production time per post
- Decision: Can this actually be done in 2-5 hrs/week with $50-100/month?

**If Research Says Yes**:
- Run a 90-day validation sprint starting Q2 2026 (after OfferPath decision and ScaleUp stabilization)
- Success gate: Any revenue within 90 days
- Outsource what you can to stay within time constraints

**If Research Says No**:
- Park until resources free up (post-Prevyu validation, post-OfferPath decision)
- Or adjust scope (simpler content, different platform, hire more help)
